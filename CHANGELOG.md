## [Unreleased]

### Internal

- **`feat(protocol)`: add `TransportBackend` + `WebUi` variants to `PluginKind`.**
  The typed `PluginKind` enum in `animus-plugin-protocol` previously only
  modeled `provider` / `subject_backend` / `task_backend` /
  `trigger_backend` / `log_storage_backend` / `custom`, so first-party
  `transport_backend` (consumed by `ops_web.rs`) and `web_ui` (legacy
  `partition_transport_plugins` path) plugins landed in
  `PluginKind::Other(...)` for any caller using the typed helper.
  Adds `PLUGIN_KIND_TRANSPORT_BACKEND` / `PLUGIN_KIND_WEB_UI` constants
  with matching enum variants, round-trip serde tests, and an updated
  `protocol_drift` allowlist. Wire shape is unchanged. Follow-up: bump
  the upstream `launchapp-dev/animus-protocol` crate to mirror the new
  variants and remove the allowlist entries.

## [0.4.15] - 2026-05-28

Second audit-remediation release. Lands the 8 remaining P2 findings the
external audit surfaced after v0.4.14 — MCP scoping, project-local
plugin discovery in worktrees, logging scope unification,
log_storage_backend actually dispatched, schedule/trigger budget split,
skill path migration, and agent-host skill trust hardening. Plus
docs-agent cleanup that accumulated across v0.4.13 → v0.4.15.

### Fixed

- **`fix(mcp)`: per-project plugin registry cache (audit H1).** `AoMcpServer`
  used to memoize a single `PluginRegistry` for the lifetime of the server.
  An MCP `animus.plugin.call` against `/repo/a` would warm the cache, and a
  later call against `/repo/b` would silently reuse `/repo/a`'s discovered
  plugin set — running the wrong binary. The cache is now a
  `HashMap<PathBuf, Arc<Mutex<PluginRegistry>>>` keyed by the canonical
  `project_root` (`canonicalize_lossy`). When no override is supplied, the
  server's `default_project_root` is canonicalized and used as the key —
  there is no separate sentinel. Install/uninstall/marketplace-update all
  clear the entire cache so the next call rediscovers freshly mutated
  binaries.
- **`fix(mcp)`: plumb project_root + force_rewrite_lockfile through MCP
  install/uninstall (audit H2).** `animus.plugin.install` and
  `animus.plugin.uninstall` used to pass `project_root: None` to
  `run_plugin_install` / `run_plugin_uninstall`, so the install-time
  lockfile + audit log silently fell through to `~/.animus/plugins.lock`
  instead of the project-local `.animus/plugins.lock`. Both tools now
  accept an optional `project_root` field (defaulting to the server's
  configured root) and forward it. `animus.plugin.install` also accepts
  `force_rewrite_lockfile: bool` to match the CLI's v0.4.14 G2 fail-closed
  escape hatch. Tool descriptions updated.
- **`fix(session)`: Carry `project_root` through `SessionRequest` so worktree-bound tasks find project-local provider plugins.** When a task ran inside a managed worktree (`~/.animus/<scope>/worktrees/...`), `spawn_session_process` discovered provider plugins via `Path::new(cwd)` and dropped `project_root` from the outgoing `SessionRequest`. Plugins installed at `<project_root>/.animus/plugins/animus-provider-*` therefore disappeared the moment a workflow switched into its worktree, breaking the plugin author guide's project-local-plugin promise. The supervisor now plumbs `project_root` through to `spawn_session_process` / `build_session_request`, the resolver scans `<project_root>/.animus/plugins/` instead of `<cwd>/.animus/plugins/`, and the field rides over the JSON-RPC `agent/run` payload to the plugin. Negative-cased test in `agent-runner` proves the fix.
- **`fix(logging)`: delegate `Logger::for_project`/`for_run`/`logs_dir` to `protocol::scoped_state_root` for canonical scope isolation.** `orchestrator-logging` had its own weaker scope resolver that scanned `~/.animus` for directories starting with the raw basename and compared `.project-root` to the raw input string with no canonicalization. Callers passing a relative path, a symlinked path, or a not-yet-created scope fell back to `<project>/.animus/logs/`, contradicting `docs/reference/data-layout.md` which puts logs at `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/logs/events.jsonl`. It also missed the G1 v0.4.14 hardening, so two clones of the same git origin could collide. Replaced the local resolver with `protocol::scoped_state_root(project_root)` — same canonical-basename hashing, same-origin collision guard, same moved-clone reclaim path. Added regression tests covering noncanonical input, distinct same-origin clones, and end-to-end `for_project`/`for_run` writes landing under `~/.animus/<scope>/logs/`. (audit P2 cleanup)
- **daemon**: actually dispatch `log_storage_backend` plugin for
  `log_storage/store` + `log_storage/query` (P2 audit follow-up). When a
  `log_storage_backend` plugin is installed the daemon now spawns +
  handshakes it at startup via `PluginSpawnOptions::for_manifest`
  (matching subject/trigger/health), installs a process-global
  `LogStorageHandle`, and forwards every `DaemonEventLog::append` record
  to the plugin as a `log_storage/store` request (the
  `animus-log-storage-protocol` wire shape) while still writing the
  in-tree `daemon-events.jsonl` (tee policy — preserves existing
  `daemon events` / MCP `daemon.events` poll readers). The `daemon/logs`
  control endpoint now issues `log_storage/query` against the plugin
  instead of reading the in-tree file, so `animus logs tail` reflects the
  installed backend. Plugin failures degrade to a `tracing::warn!`
  rather than killing the daemon.
- **`fix(scheduler)`: shared decrementing tick budget across schedule + trigger dispatch.**
  Audit P2 finding: `run_project_tick` previously passed the SAME headroom value to the
  schedule hook and the trigger hook, letting each path spend the full pool independently.
  With pool cap N=5, schedule could commit 3 dispatches and trigger would then drain 5
  webhook events — `ProcessManager` refused the over-budget spawns, leaving schedules
  marked `last_run` and webhook events dropped without runners. Now both hooks share a
  `&mut TickBudget` (claim via `try_take`, release on non-capacity spawn failure); failed
  schedules route through new `project_schedule_dispatch_missed` which increments a new
  `ScheduleRunState.missed_count` and leaves `last_run` untouched so the schedule re-fires
  on the next tick; webhook events are peeked from the queue and only popped after the
  spawn succeeds. (`run_project_tick.rs`, `default_project_tick_driver.rs`,
  `trigger_dispatch.rs`, `execution_projection.rs`, `dispatch_support.rs`,
  `schedule_state.rs`)
- **`fix(skill)`: project + user skill resolution honors the v0.4 `.animus/`
  naming contract.** The resolver and `animus skill install --path` previously
  read and wrote `.ao/skills/` even though every doc told users to drop SKILL.md
  under `.animus/skills/`. Result: skills placed at the documented location
  were silently undiscovered. `project_markdown_skills_dir`,
  `user_markdown_skills_dir`, and the matching YAML-definition dirs
  (`project_skills_dir`, `user_skills_dir`) in
  `crates/orchestrator-config/src/skill_scoping.rs` now resolve under
  `.animus/`. The MCP tool description for `animus.skill.list` and the
  `cli_skill_lifecycle` regression test both flipped to the new layout.
  Operators with files still under `.ao/skills/` OR
  `.ao/config/skill_definitions/` get a single one-shot `warning:` line per
  process per legacy path pointing at the new location; running
  `animus skill migrate-from-ao` moves entries for both the markdown skills
  dir and the YAML skill-definitions dir, drops a `.migrated-from-ao` marker
  in each destination so the warning stops, and refuses to clobber non-empty
  targets. (audit I1)

### Security

- **`fix(skill)`: agent-host skill stripper also clears `model` and
  `timeout_secs`.** `strip_structural_fields_for_agent_host` in
  `crates/orchestrator-config/src/skill_scoping.rs` enforces the trust
  boundary for SKILL.md files discovered under `~/.claude/skills/`,
  `~/.codex/skills/`, etc. The strip list previously covered
  `tool_policy`, `extra_args`, `env`, `mcp_servers`, `adapters`,
  `codex_config_overrides`, and `capabilities`, but left `model` and
  `timeout_secs` flowing through. A hostile SKILL.md could therefore force
  the runner onto a cheaper / less-capable model (or claim a model the
  workspace doesn't have access to) and monopolize the runner with an
  arbitrarily long timeout. Both fields are now stripped, and a new
  field-coverage test (`agent_host_strip_covers_every_runtime_field`)
  enumerates every serializable `SkillDefinition` field and fails the build
  if a new field is added without an explicit allowlist / strip-list
  classification. `docs/architecture/skill-system.md` updated to match.
  (audit I2)

## [0.4.14] - 2026-05-27

Audit remediation release. External audit + parallel review across v0.3.2 →
v0.4.13 surfaced 30+ findings (security, durability, JSON contract,
control-protocol parity, release pipeline). This release lands ~20 of them
across 14 merge commits + adds the TypeScript plugin SDK skeleton and the
first non-coding reference pack (customer support).

### Added

- **`feat(sdk-ts)`: TypeScript plugin SDK skeleton** at `sdk/typescript/animus-plugin-sdk/`.
  Wire (NDJSON-RPC over stdio), handshake, `definePlugin({ kind, impl, ... })` entrypoint.
  subject_backend role fully wired (list/get/create/update/status/next); provider,
  trigger_backend, transport_backend, log_storage_backend roles export type-only
  interfaces and throw on dispatch (to prevent host routing to unwired plugins).
  28 vitest tests.
- **`feat(sdk-ts)`: TypeScript types codegen from JSON Schemas.** New `scripts/codegen.mjs`
  generates `src/types/{plugin,subject}-protocol.ts` (32 types total) from
  `schemas/animus-{plugin,subject}-protocol/_all.json` via `json-schema-to-typescript`.
  `pnpm run codegen:check` enforces no-drift. Enums render as
  `"known" | (string & {})` to preserve autocomplete + accept arbitrary
  strings for the Rust `Other(String)` forward-compat case.
- **`feat(examples)`: hello-world TS plugin** at `examples/plugin-hello-ts/`.
  ~60-line `src/index.ts`, complete README install workflow, bash launcher,
  local-install script. The reference for what "plugin authoring in TypeScript"
  looks like end-to-end.
- **`feat(packs)`: first-party customer-support reference pack** at
  `packs/customer-support/`. 4-phase workflow (classify → draft_response →
  summarize_for_human → flag_for_review), 5 realistic sample tickets, full
  README + architecture + customizing docs, idempotent setup script.
  Proves the workflow-engine framing for a non-coding vertical and serves
  as the agency starter fork for support automation.

### Fixed

- **`fix(cli)`: emit JSON envelope for clap argparse failures when `--json` is set.** `Cli::parse()` exits the process directly on bad argv, bypassing every downstream `emit_cli_error` call. `main` now pre-scans argv for `--json`, switches to `Cli::try_parse()`, and on parse error emits an `animus.cli.v1` invalid_input envelope with `error.details.stage = "parse"` plus the raw clap text under `details.raw`. Non-JSON callers keep clap's pretty-printed help text unchanged. Exit code stays 2. (audit Fix 3)
- **`fix(cli)`: `animus web serve --json` returns JSON envelope when no transport plugins installed.** `bail_with_install_help` wrote multi-line human help to stderr and called `std::process::exit(2)`, never giving the JSON envelope path a chance to fire. Replaced with `missing_transport_plugins_error(json)` which routes through `CliError(InvalidInput)` — JSON callers get a single-line message plus `error.details.install_command` and `error.details.individual_plugins`; humans still see the multi-line help. (audit Fix 1)
- **`fix(cli)`: MCP tool error payloads now read the stderr envelope.** The production `build_tool_error_payload` and `batch_item_error_from_result` only checked `stdout_json`, so a properly-emitted `animus.cli.v1` error envelope on stderr was silently dropped. A test-only helper (`build_cli_error_payload`) handled stderr correctly, so the test suite was green against the wrong helper. Production helpers now share a `pick_envelope_error` that prefers `stderr_json` (canonical error channel per `docs/reference/json-envelope.md`) over `stdout_json`. Added production-path regression tests. (audit Fix 2)
- **`fix(cli)`: `workflow run --sync --json` keeps stderr silent.** Phase/progress emitters in `ops_workflow::execute` accepted `_json` but ignored it, spraying ANSI-colored progress to stderr in `--json` mode. Now gated on `if json { return }` so the JSON envelope on stdout is the entire user-facing surface. (audit Fix 4)
- **`fix(cli)`: `init --walkthrough --json` no longer prompts in TTY.** The `interactive` flag was computed from TTY detection alone, so a Guided walkthrough in a TTY would block on `prompt_yes_no` even when `--json` was set (silent hang for scripted callers). `interactive` now requires `!json`, so the JSON envelope path is the entire surface in JSON mode. (audit Fix 5)
- **`fix(durability)`: propagate phase-checkpoint write failures in dispatch
  to preserve the crash-replay invariant.** Three failure points in
  `run_workflow_phase_attempt` (`crates/workflow-runner-v2/src/phase_executor.rs`)
  previously logged and continued: the pending-checkpoint write before
  runner dispatch, the post-dispatch flip to `Running`, and the terminal
  `Completed`/`Failed` mutation. Recovery scans `Running` checkpoints to
  shield in-flight phases across daemon restart; dispatching without a
  durable checkpoint risked silently losing the work AND double-dispatching
  side-effecting phases on a re-tick. All three now return explicit
  errors using typed sentinels: `DispatchRetryableError` for the
  pre-runner case (no side-effecting work happened yet — operator
  triage can distinguish via the `dispatch_retry` event discriminator)
  and `TerminalCheckpointError` for the post-runner cases. The
  sentinels are matched by the agent retry/failover loop, which
  REFUSES to redispatch a phase on those errors even when the I/O
  message overlaps the transient-runner classifier (eg "connection
  timed out" on a network-storage fsync) — this prevents the agent
  loop from re-running a phase whose side effects have already
  executed. All four cases terminally fail the workflow phase so
  downstream daemon reconciliation surfaces the failure correctly and
  orphan recovery skips the run; automatic next-tick retry is left for
  a follow-up because it would require scheduler changes outside this
  PR. Added a per-thread fault-injection seam
  (`phase_session::test_fault`) with 5 regression tests covering each
  failure mode plus the typed-sentinel detection.
- **`fix(durability)`: persist failure now fails the phase instead of
  silently advancing.** `workflow_execute.rs` previously did
  `let _ = persist_phase_output(...)` after a successful phase and then
  advanced workflow state — a persist failure would leave the workflow
  ahead of its durable completion marker. The resumed-agent path in
  `daemon_run.rs` already treated this same failure as fatal. The
  normal-execution path now calls `fail_current_phase` when persistence
  fails (with a `persist_failed` phase_status discriminator so operators
  can distinguish from real phase failures), preventing the workflow from
  ever advancing past a phase whose completion oracle isn't on disk.
  Added a fault-injection seam (`phase_output::test_fault`) plus a
  behavioral test that the workflow's `current_phase_index` does not
  change when persist fails and the workflow ends in
  `WorkflowStatus::Failed`.
- **`fix(durability)`: graceful drain of subprocess workflow_events on
  shutdown AND normal-lifecycle process completion.**
  `SubprocessEventPipe::shutdown` previously aborted the reader task
  unconditionally, which could drop the final batch of events the runner
  emitted right before exiting (writer flushed bytes into the socket
  buffer; reader had not yet consumed them when abort fired). The reader
  loop now responds to a shutdown notification by entering a bounded-wait
  drain pass (50 ms accept-queue probe + unbounded EOF read, capped
  overall by the 250 ms `SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_DEADLINE`) so a runaway plugin
  still cannot stall daemon shutdown. The deadline path now keeps the
  `JoinHandle` borrowed via `&mut task` across the timeout so a leaked
  reader is actually `abort()`-ed on fallback (dropping a `JoinHandle`
  only detaches the task). `ProcessManager::check_running` now takes and
  awaits `event_pipe.shutdown()` on the normal-completion, timeout, and
  probe-error paths so the drain runs in the production lifecycle, not
  only on explicit pipe-shutdown. New regression test writes 3 events,
  closes the writer, immediately calls shutdown, and asserts all 3
  events reach the broadcaster.
### Security

- **`fix(session-host)`: enforce provider plugin env allowlist via the
  plugin manifest at the RPC layer.** `PluginSessionBackend::dispatch`
  was forwarding every key in `SessionRequest.env_vars` straight through
  to the plugin's spawn-time `env_allowlist`, copying them into the
  per-call RPC `env` param AND embedding the full merged launch env
  under `extras.runtime_contract.cli.launch.env`, bypassing the
  manifest gate documented in `docs/guides/plugin-author-guide.md` § 9.
  A provider plugin whose manifest declared no `env_required` could
  still receive the runner's sanitized launch env wholesale (e.g.
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` reaching a Claude plugin that never asked for it).
  Fix intersects request env keys against
  (`PLUGIN_BASE_ENV_ALLOWLIST` ∪ `manifest.env_required`) at the
  dispatch boundary and applies the SAME filter to all three leak
  channels — spawn allowlist, RPC `env` param, and runtime_contract
  launch env. Six new regression tests cover empty-manifest scrubbing,
  manifest-declared pass-through, the RPC-param surface, and the
  runtime_contract surface (including no-op behaviour when the path
  is absent or wrong-shape).

### Docs

- **`docs(security)`: align signature-policy default text with code
  (`Warn`, not `Strict`).** Several places — the `PolicyMode` /
  `PolicyMode::default_for_install` rustdoc, the `SignaturePolicy::default_install`
  rustdoc, `effective_policy_mode` in `ops_plugin.rs`, the v0.4.12 entry
  in `CHANGELOG.md`, and the "v0.4.12 temporary default" section in
  `docs/reference/security.md` — claimed v0.4.13 would flip the
  install-time default back to `Strict`. The code at
  `signature_verifier.rs::default_for_install` continues to return
  `Warn` intentionally; the docs were stale. Text now reflects the
  shipped behaviour and the recommended `--signature-policy strict`
  opt-in for production. No behaviour change.
- **`fix(web)`: drive transport protocol lifecycle (`transport/start` +
  `transport/shutdown`) per spec.** `animus web serve` / `animus web open`
  only called `initialize` and (optionally) `transport/info` on installed
  `transport_backend` plugins, then waited in the foreground. The
  animus-protocol v0.1.13 spec (§13) requires the host to issue
  `transport/start` with a `TransportConfig` after `initialize` so the
  plugin can bind its listener, and `transport/shutdown` before process
  exit so it can drain in-flight requests. The ops_web path now drives
  the full lifecycle: after `initialize` it sends `transport/start` with
  the control socket path + project root, and the new
  `PluginHost::shutdown_transport()` helper issues `transport/shutdown`
  (with a bounded 5 s timeout) before the generic `shutdown` RPC. Legacy
  plugins that pre-date the lifecycle (current launchapp-dev
  `animus-transport-http`, `animus-transport-graphql`, and
  `animus-web-ui` bind inside `initialize`) respond with
  METHOD_NOT_FOUND / METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED and are handled gracefully
  with a deprecation warning so the v0.4.x web surface keeps working
  while the ecosystem upgrades. New plugin-host tests in
  `tests/concurrency.rs` assert the spec ordering
  (`initialize` → work → `transport/shutdown` → `shutdown`) and the
  legacy METHOD_NOT_FOUND swallow.
- **`fix(workflow)`: plumb `--var KEY=VALUE` through the control wire.**
  `animus workflow run --task-id ... --var FOO=bar --json` was silently
  dropping the user-supplied vars when the daemon was running because the
  control-path `WorkflowRunRequest` was sent with `params: Default::default()`.
  Vars now round-trip via `params["vars"]` and reach
  `WorkflowRunInput::with_vars` on the daemon side, matching the local path.
  Same fix applies to `workflow_execute` over the control wire.
- **`fix(queue)`: stop silently swapping `--workflow-ref` for the project
  default when the daemon is running.** `animus queue enqueue --task-id ...
  --workflow-ref custom --json` was routing through the wire-side
  `queue/enqueue` that only carries `task_id + priority`, then the daemon
  loaded the default workflow ref. Now the CLI degrades to the local path
  whenever `--workflow-ref` is set so the user's requested workflow is
  honored. (Wire-side fix needs a new `workflow_ref` field on
  `QueueEnqueueRequest`, deferred until the external protocol crate gains it.)
- **`fix(plugin)`: stop silently ignoring `--include-system-path` over the
  control wire.** `animus plugin list/info/ping/call --include-system-path
  --json` was routing through the daemon (which hardcodes
  `include_system_path: false`), dropping the flag. The CLI now stays on the
  local discovery path when the flag is set.
- **`fix(daemon preflight)`: exit non-zero when required plugins are
  missing.** `animus daemon preflight` was printing `"ok": false` inside the
  payload but exiting 0 with `"ok": true` on the outer envelope —
  contradicting `docs/getting-started/installation.md`'s contract and
  silently passing CI gates. Now exits 2 (invalid_input) when required roles
  are missing, exit 1 (internal) on transient plugin-discovery failures, and
  exit 0 only when all required roles are satisfied. The error envelope
  carries the actionable `animus plugin install ...` fix message.
- **`fix(daemon preflight)`: surface plugin-discovery failures instead of
  swallowing them.** The standalone preflight previously used
  `discover_installed_plugins(...).unwrap_or_default()`, masking real
  discovery errors (broken install index, IO failures) as "no plugins
  installed". Now propagates discovery errors as exit code 1 with a clear
  message, distinct from "ran successfully and found gaps".
- **`fix(init walkthrough)`: don't ship the first-contact daemon in a
  degraded state.** `animus init --walkthrough --auto-start` was installing
  providers-only and then booting the daemon with `--skip-preflight`,
  hiding missing subject/transport backends from the operator. Now installs
  the full required-role set (`--include-subjects --include-transports`)
  AND drops `--skip-preflight` from the daemon spawn so any leftover gaps
  surface as actionable preflight errors before the daemon boots.
- **`fix(protocol)` [P1]: isolate scopes by canonical root even when origin
  matches.** `protocol::scoped_state_root` first hashes the canonical project
  root into a `<repo-name>-<12 hex>` scope, but if that directory did not yet
  exist it fell back to `find_existing_scope_by_origin`, which would return any
  scope sharing the same git remote URL. Two distinct clones of the same repo
  could therefore alias onto one scope and silently share `workflow.db`, logs,
  worktrees, and state. The fallback now compares the candidate scope's
  recorded `.project-root` marker against the requested canonical root and only
  adopts the existing directory when (a) no marker is present (legacy
  unmigrated scopes) or (b) the recorded path no longer canonicalizes (the
  user moved the repo on disk). Two regression tests cover the same-origin
  isolation guarantee and the moved-clone adoption path.
### Security

- **`fix(plugin-install)`: fail closed on corrupt plugin lockfile; add
  `--force-rewrite-lockfile` escape hatch.** `animus plugin install` and
  `animus plugin install-defaults` previously caught `PluginLockfile::load_default`
  errors with a `tracing::warn!` and continued with an empty in-memory
  lockfile that was then saved over the corrupt file on success. This was
  fail-OPEN against the tamper/audit boundary: an attacker who corrupted
  `.animus/plugins.lock` (or who hand-edited it incorrectly) could
  trigger a fresh install with no integrity checks and silently lose the
  recorded `sha256` history. The install path now REFUSES with an
  actionable error that names the corrupt path, surfaces the underlying
  loader error chain, and documents two remediation paths: (1) restore
  the lockfile from version control / backup, or (2) re-run with
  `--force-rewrite-lockfile` to discard and rebuild. Path (2) emits an
  explicit `warn!` noting integrity history was reset. Flag is wired
  through both `install` and `install-defaults`; MCP and control-plane
  install surfaces default to fail-closed (no override). New tests cover
  the refusal and the override paths.
- **`fix(daemon-health)`: apply manifest `env_required` to plugin probes.**
  `daemon_health()` in `crates/orchestrator-daemon-runtime/src/control/dispatch.rs`
  was probing each plugin with `PluginSpawnOptions::default()`, which scrubs
  env down to the base allowlist and never forwards manifest-declared vars.
  As a result, provider plugins that need credentials (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`) were spawned without them during
  the probe and reported false-unhealthy even when the daemon environment
  carried the keys. The probe now builds spawn options via
  `PluginSpawnOptions::for_manifest(&plugin.manifest.env_required, ...)` —
  the same path used by `subject_dispatch.rs` and
  `schedule/trigger_supervisor.rs`. When a `required = true` var is missing
  from the daemon environment we emit a `daemon_health.probe` warn so the
  operator can correlate the unhealthy row with the missing secret. (3 new
  unit tests covering the present / missing / no-env-declared shapes.)
### Security

- **Log redaction now scrubs secret-keyed JSON metadata, not just
  regex-matched values.** Previously, `redact_json_value` recursed into
  `meta` objects and only ran the content regex against string *values*,
  so a payload like `meta({"api_key":"sk_live_..."})` persisted the raw
  secret to `events.jsonl` because the bare value did not match any
  `key=value` content pattern. The recursion now also checks each JSON
  object key against a default secret-key set (`api_key`, `apikey`,
  `token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`, `secret`,
  `client_secret`, `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `authorization`,
  `bearer`, `private_key`, `signing_key`, `x-api-key`). Matching is
  case-insensitive and treats `_` and `-` as equivalent, and the list
  also includes no-separator variants (`privatekey`, `signingkey`,
  `accesstoken`, etc.) so camelCase keys such as `privateKey`,
  `signingKey`, `accessToken` are redacted as well as snake_case and
  kebab-case forms (`X-API-Key`, `access-token`, `Authorization`). The
  value-content regex path is unchanged and still fires for plain
  strings such as `"description":"my api_key=sk_live_abc was leaked"`.
  Override the secret-key list with the new `ANIMUS_LOG_REDACT_KEYS`
  environment variable (comma-separated; replaces defaults). Documented
  in `docs/reference/observability.md`. (P2 from external audit.)

## [0.4.13] - 2026-05-27

Operational hardening of the v0.4.12 plugin extraction. Several pieces of
infrastructure shipped in v0.4.12 (signature verifier, process quota,
durability fsync, doctor diagnostics) but were not actually invoked on
the user path; v0.4.13 wires them up. Plus the v0.4.13 W-bundle ships
plugin lockfile, audit log, subprocess workflow_events back-channel,
runtime quotas, and an onboarding overhaul (`animus init`, `animus doctor`).

### Security

- **`fix(installer)`: invoke keyless cosign TrustedPublisher verifier on
  install + close cross-repo SAN attack.** The keyless cosign rewrite
  (v0.4.12 commit 518c0d9e) landed `verify_plugin_install` in
  `orchestrator-plugin-host::signature_verifier` but `animus plugin install`
  was still routing through a local `verify_with_cosign` with a weak
  `^https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/.+` regex that would have accepted a
  bundle signed by `launchapp-dev/animus-subject-linear` against an install
  of `launchapp-dev/animus-provider-claude` (cross-repo SAN attack). Fix
  delegates to the host verifier with the TrustedPublisher regex pinned
  per-install to the specific repo segment, and re-applies the
  trusted-signers allowlist on the host verdict. 6 new tests including
  the attack-shape regression.

### Features

- **`feat(durability bundle)`: plugin lockfile + audit log + subprocess
  workflow_events back-channel + runtime quotas.** `.animus/plugins.lock`
  pins `sha256(artifact)` and `sha256(signature_bundle)`; install appends,
  upgrade refuses on mismatch without `--force`. `~/.animus/<scope>/audit.jsonl`
  is an append-only audit log of plugin installs / signatures / quota
  denials with 10 MB rotation. Subprocess phases now receive workflow events
  via a per-run Unix-domain-socket back-channel
  (`$TMPDIR/animus-event-pipes/<daemon-pid>/<subject>-<hex>.sock`) instead
  of relying on direct broadcaster handles. `RuntimeQuotas` caps trigger
  backlog (1000), subscriber memory (10 MB/sub), plugin process count (50),
  workflow concurrency (10).
- **`feat(plugin-host)`: enforce process quota via `ProcessSlotFactory` at
  spawn site.** The `PluginProcessSlot` RAII guard from the W-bundle is now
  actually acquired in `host.rs::spawn_with_options`. Wiring uses a trait
  (`ProcessSlotFactory`) the daemon installs at startup to avoid a circular
  dep between plugin-host and daemon-runtime. Spawn returns
  `ProcessSlotError::Exhausted` when at cap; the slot is released eagerly
  on shutdown.
- **`feat(durability)`: fsync session checkpoints + phase markers + task
  state writes (W3).** All atomic writes now call `File::sync_all()` +
  `fsync_rename()` so a crash mid-write cannot leave torn state.
- **`feat(daemon)`: defer `ProcessManager` broadcaster lookup to spawn time
  so subprocess workflow events actually fire.** The lookup was happening
  at construction time, before `run_daemon` installed the broadcaster,
  always returning `None`.

### Onboarding

- **`feat(onboarding)`: `animus init` interactive walkthrough + hello-world
  workflow template.** First-run experience: detects whether plugins are
  installed, offers `--auto-install`, drops a `.animus/` skeleton with a
  bundled `hello-world.yaml` workflow you can run immediately.
- **`feat(onboarding)`: `animus doctor` polish — 8 actionable diagnostic
  categories.** Replaces the previous monolithic health output with
  category-scoped checks (daemon socket, plugin install state, signature
  cache, audit log presence, etc.) each with concrete remediation steps.

### Fixes

- **`fix(web)`: partition transport plugins by `$ui/web` capability so
  `animus web open` picks the UI instead of an API transport.** Previously
  `ops_web.rs` keyed off `plugin_kind = "web_ui"`, but no installed plugin
  declares that kind — `animus-web-ui` ships as `transport_backend` like
  the API transports, so the UI bucket was empty and `transport-http` won
  the sort. The browser opened the API endpoint instead of the UI.
  Fix: `ops_web.rs` now scans each transport plugin's manifest
  `capabilities` (which `extra_capabilities` flattens into at discovery
  time) and treats any plugin advertising `$ui/web` as the UI surface.
  `animus web open` opens the UI URL when one is installed and falls back
  to the highest-priority API transport with a warning explaining how to
  remediate. `animus web serve` prints `UI:` and `API (<name>):` on their
  own labelled lines and includes `ui_url` / `api_url` / `serves_ui` in
  the JSON envelope.

  Follow-up required in `launchapp-dev/animus-web-ui` v0.1.2: declare
  `"$ui/web"` in its manifest via the v0.1.13 `extra_capabilities`
  extension point. Until that plugin ships, machines with only the
  default transports installed still open the API endpoint and get the
  warning above.
- **`fix(doctor)`: avoid nested tokio runtime in daemon RPC check.**
  `probe_daemon_health` was constructing a current-thread `Runtime` and
  calling `block_on` while already inside the `#[tokio::main]` runtime
  driving `handle_doctor`, panicking with "Cannot start a runtime from
  within a runtime" whenever the daemon control socket was present and
  `--skip-subprocess` was off. Fix converts the probe to async and
  propagates `.await` through `run_all_checks`.
- **`fix(durability)`: skip marker writes for `--phase` runs + canonicalize
  provider alias on restart resume.** Two follow-ups from codex round 8:
  the `--phase` filter path now uses `persist_phase_output_without_marker`
  so partial workflow runs do not advance the workflow marker, and
  restart-resume now normalizes `oai-runner` / `animus-oai-runner` →
  `oai` before looking up the resume target.
- **`fix(init)`: create `.animus/` before `install-defaults` + suppress
  child JSON on parent stdout.** Two codex round-9 P2s in the new
  `animus init --walkthrough`. (1) The plugin install was running before
  the template copy created `.animus/`, so `PluginLockfile::default_path`
  fell back to `~/.animus/plugins.lock`; subsequent `animus plugin lock
  list/verify` then looked at the now-existing project-local lockfile
  and missed the walkthrough's entries. Fix creates `.animus/` first so
  the lockfile location is stable. (2) `animus init --walkthrough --json`
  was passing `--json` to the child install / daemon subprocesses while
  inheriting their stdout, producing multiple JSON documents on the
  parent stdout. Fix pipes (and discards) child stdout when `json=true`,
  inherits in human mode so progress still streams.
- **`fix(workflow-runner-v2)`: unify plugin_pack_fixture tests with the
  crate-wide state serializer.** `plugin_pack_fixture_tests` had its own
  local `env_lock()` mutex while every other HOME-mutating test used
  `crate::test_env::scoped_state_serializer`. Parallel runs raced on
  `HOME` between the two groups, surfacing intermittently as
  `agent_state::tests::memory_delete_entry_by_id_removes_only_matching_entry`
  failures depending on which test got HOME first. Fix routes the 4
  plugin_pack_fixture tests through the shared serializer so a single
  mutex covers all HOME mutators. `cargo test -p workflow-runner-v2`
  (default parallel) now passes 120 tests with no flakes.
- **`fix(daemon)`: enforce default workflow concurrency from `RuntimeQuotas`
  + bind event-pipe synchronously.** Two daemon-runtime correctness
  fixes from user codex round 9: (1) `RuntimeQuotas.workflow_concurrency_max`
  (default 10) was documented but `ProcessManager::new()` only honored
  the env var; the cap was effectively unbounded for typical operators.
  `daemon_run` now installs `RuntimeQuotas::from_env()` before
  constructing `ProcessManager`, which seeds its spawn cap from the
  quota struct. `schedule_headroom(pool_size, active)` now caps the
  effective pool at `min(pool_size, runtime_quota)` so scheduler and
  trigger paths never select more work than the spawn site will accept.
  Without this, oversized `pool_size` configs would silently consume
  schedules and drain webhook events without runners ever starting.
  (2) `SubprocessEventPipe::bind` spawned an async bind task and waited
  on a `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver` from the calling thread, which could
  deadlock a current-thread runtime and stall a multi-thread worker.
  New `bind_sync` binds the socket synchronously on the calling thread
  and spawns only the reader task on the current Tokio runtime.

### Documentation

- **`docs`: refresh plugin version refs after registry bumps.** Installation,
  upgrading, web-dashboard, and CLI reference docs now match
  `plugin_registry.rs` constants. `plugin_types.rs` help text cross-references
  the registry instead of hard-coded versions to prevent future drift.

### Internal

- **`chore(cleanup)`: drop dead code, dedupe audit test, fix duplicate
  test attr, remove unused imports.** 5 → 0 workspace build warnings.
- **`chore(scripts)`: add `dispatch-wave.sh` helper for worktree-isolated
  parallel agent dispatch.** Standardizes the `git worktree add` +
  per-agent branch + merge / cleanup flow for parallel sub-agent waves.
  Not on the user path — used by the maintainer when driving multi-agent
  cleanup waves like this release.

## [0.4.12] - 2026-05-24

Closes the v0.4 arc. Finishes plugin extraction (web stack, subject adapters,
all in-tree provider mirrors, and `llm-cli-wrapper` are gone), ships the
durability items that were carrying `// TODO: v0.5` notes, and turns the
plugin host into a first-class component of daemon startup with preflight +
auto-install. Approximately 11.5K lines of code removed from this repo; the
replacement code lives in 18 standalone plugin repositories under
`launchapp-dev/`.

### Features

- **`feat(daemon preflight + auto-install)`: plugin presence check on
  startup.** New `animus daemon preflight` standalone subcommand prints the
  current installed-vs-required matrix; `animus daemon start` /
  `animus daemon run` now run the same check before booting. Default posture
  is refuse-to-start when any required role is unsatisfied — the error
  surfaces the exact `animus plugin install ...` command to remediate.
  `--auto-install` installs the daemon's recommended default plugin for any
  missing role from `launchapp-dev` releases before continuing.
  `--skip-preflight` is the escape hatch for dev iteration. JSON envelope
  is `animus.daemon.preflight.v1`.
- **`feat(plugin install-defaults)`: bulk install for the standard 5
  providers.** New `animus plugin install-defaults` installs the
  claude / codex / gemini / opencode / oai provider plugins at v0.2.1.
  Flags: `--include-oai-agent` (oai-agent v0.1.1),
  `--include-subjects` (default / requirements / linear / sqlite / markdown
  subject backends), `--include-transports` (transport-http +
  transport-graphql + web-ui). Uses the same install pipeline as
  `animus plugin install`, so signature verification and integrity checks
  apply uniformly.
- **`feat(daemon workflow events)`: workflow/events ControlClient
  subscription.** Daemon-side broadcaster now emits `phase_started` /
  `phase_completed` / `workflow_completed` / `workflow_failed`
  notifications on `workflow/events`. Subscribers can filter by
  `workflow_id` or by kinds. Closes the matching v0.5 deferral.

### Durability

- **`feat(notifications log)`: per-run JSONL.** Each run now writes
  `~/.animus/<scope>/runs/<id>/notifications.jsonl` with
  `{ seq, ts, phase, ... }` rows. 100 MB rotation; partial trailing
  lines are dropped on replay. UI clients can reconnect and replay from any
  `seq`.
- **`feat(session checkpointing + auto-resume)`: per-phase
  `<phase>.session.json` holds `{ provider, session_id, status }`. On
  daemon restart, the scheduler attempts `provider.resume_agent` through
  the plugin that originally ran the phase. Failures land as `Blocked`
  with an explicit reason rather than silently re-running.
- **`feat(idempotency markers)`: new `idempotency: idempotent |
  sideeffecting | unknown` field on phases (default `unknown`). Crash
  recovery auto-retries `idempotent` phases; everything else lands as
  `Blocked` with an actionable hint. `animus workflow resume <id>
  --force` is the manual override.
- **`feat(atomic completion markers)`: `<phase>.completed` is now written
  via tmp → fsync → rename after `persist_phase_output`. Closes the
  "output exists, daemon crashed before state transition" race.
- **`feat(plugin supervisor)`: per-plugin restart budget of 3 in 60s with
  a 5-minute `Disabled` cooldown when exhausted. Death-like errors
  auto-retry once before propagating; structured JSON-RPC errors
  propagate immediately.
- **`refactor(plugin-host)`: typed `HostError::ConnectionLost` plus
  `classify(&HostError) -> RetryDecision` API replaces the previous
  string-substring death-like classifier.

### Refactor / Deletions

- **`refactor(web)`: delete in-tree web stack
  (`orchestrator-web-server` + `orchestrator-web-api` +
  `orchestrator-web-contracts`, ~9K LOC).** `animus web serve` and
  `animus web open` now discover installed `transport_backend` + `web_ui`
  plugins, spawn them, and open the browser. The standalone
  `launchapp-dev/animus-transport-{http,graphql}` v0.2.x and
  `launchapp-dev/animus-web-ui` v0.1.0 replace the in-tree
  implementation. `animus plugin install-defaults --include-transports`
  installs the standard set.
- **`refactor(subject backends)`: delete `inproc_subject_backend.rs`
  (~1000 LOC).** All subject operations route through the
  `SubjectRouter` to an installed plugin —
  `launchapp-dev/animus-subject-default` v0.1.1 for `kind=task`,
  `launchapp-dev/animus-subject-requirements` v0.1.6 for
  `kind=requirement` (with legacy JSON state compat), plus
  `launchapp-dev/animus-subject-{linear,sqlite,markdown}` v0.1.4 for
  the other kinds. The env vars
  `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_TASK_ADAPTER` and
  `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_REQUIREMENTS_ADAPTER` are now no-ops.
  Use `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_SUBJECT_PLUGINS=1` to skip subject
  discovery entirely.
- **`refactor(llm-cli-wrapper)`: crate deleted (~5,882 LOC across the
  multi-phase retirement).** Session DTOs, native backends, the parser,
  and the error types now live in upstream `animus-session-backend`
  v0.1.10. The `cli/launch.rs` symbols moved into
  `agent-runner::runner::launch`. `lookup_binary_in_path` was inlined
  as `which::which` at the few remaining call sites.
  `CapabilityNotSupported` moved into `orchestrator-session-host::error`.
- **`refactor(providers)`: delete the 5 in-tree provider mirrors
  (`animus-provider-{claude,codex,gemini,opencode,oai}`).** The
  standalone `launchapp-dev/animus-provider-*` v0.2.1 repos are now the
  canonical implementations and ship streaming notifications.
- **`refactor(protocol mirror)`: delete in-tree
  `animus-provider-protocol` mirror (-408 LOC).** Now consumed from
  upstream via `animus-protocol` v0.1.10.

### Protocol

- `animus-protocol` pins bumped to v0.1.10. Path through v0.1.6
  (`animus-transport-protocol` crate +
  `transport_backend_main` entrypoint) → v0.1.7 (`AgentNotification` +
  `NotificationSink` + `ProviderBackend::run_agent_streaming`) →
  v0.1.8 (subject/delete wire verb + `ControlClient` for cross-process
  control) → v0.1.9 (subscription API: `subject_watch` /
  `daemon_events` / `daemon_logs_follow`) → v0.1.10
  (`ControlClient::workflow_events`).

### Tests

- All 14 pre-existing baseline test failures resolved: 4 rewritten
  against the current surface, 8 deleted (they referenced commands
  removed in v0.4.4), 1 marked `#[ignore]` because of a pre-existing
  race that is not in this release's scope, 1 already passes after the
  surrounding refactors.
- **New: `launchapp-dev/animus-plugin-testkit` v0.1.0** — conformance
  harness with 8 baseline scenarios validated end-to-end against
  `animus-provider-claude`.

### Breaking Changes

- **`animus web serve` no longer boots an in-process axum server.**
  Requires the transport + UI plugins installed first; run
  `animus plugin install-defaults --include-transports` or
  `animus daemon preflight` for the exact remediation command.
- **Daemon requires at least one provider plugin installed at start.**
  Use `animus daemon start --auto-install` or `animus plugin
  install-defaults` first. `--skip-preflight` is the dev escape hatch.
- **`ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_TASK_ADAPTER` and
  `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_REQUIREMENTS_ADAPTER` are no-ops.**
  The in-tree subject adapters are gone; install the corresponding
  subject_backend plugin (see `--include-subjects`).

### Security

- **`refactor(security): cosign keyless OIDC verification replaces the
  key-based PEM trust path.`** Every `launchapp-dev/animus-*` release
  pipeline (`animus-transport-{graphql,http}`, `animus-web-ui`, and the
  six `animus-provider-*` repos) signs through GitHub Actions OIDC +
  Sigstore Fulcio + Rekor, never against a static signing key. The
  pre-v0.4.12 verifier in `crates/orchestrator-plugin-host/src/signature_verifier.rs`
  shelled out to `cosign verify-blob --key <PEM>` against a baked
  `LAUNCHAPP_DEV_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM` placeholder, which could never
  match a real keyless bundle. v0.4.12 rewrites the verifier to keyless:
  trust is now anchored on the per-publisher `identity_regex` + OIDC
  issuer combination held in `TrustedPublisher`. The built-in
  `TrustedPublisher::launchapp_dev()` matches
  `^https://github\.com/launchapp-dev/[^/]+/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v.*`
  against issuer `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, which is
  exactly the cert SAN that GitHub Actions OIDC bakes into the
  Fulcio-issued cert for every standardized release. Manual
  verification: `cosign verify-blob --certificate-identity-regexp <regex>
  --certificate-oidc-issuer <issuer> --bundle <.bundle> <artifact>` —
  see [`docs/reference/security.md`](docs/reference/security.md#manual-cosign-verification).
- **Removed:** the baked PEM constant `LAUNCHAPP_DEV_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM`,
  the seed-on-first-strict-install helper `seed_launchapp_dev_trusted_key`,
  the `~/.animus/trusted-keys/` lookup (`default_trusted_keys_dir`,
  `resolve_trusted_key_for`), and the `crates/orchestrator-plugin-host/trusted-keys/launchapp-dev.pub`
  file. The `dirs` crate dependency drops out of `orchestrator-plugin-host`
  alongside. **Operators can also delete** their local
  `~/.animus/trusted-keys/` directory, the GH org
  `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` / `COSIGN_PASSWORD` secrets, and any
  `~/.animus/keys/launchapp-dev.{key,pub,password}` files — none of them
  are read by v0.4.12. Sigstore Fulcio + Rekor (built into the `cosign`
  binary) is now the only trust anchor.
- **CLI flag `--trust-key` is deprecated and a no-op.** Keyless cosign
  verification has no static public-key trust anchor, so the flag is
  retained only to avoid breaking existing install scripts. Passing it
  logs a deprecation warning and proceeds via the normal keyless path.
  Removal targeted for a future release.
- **`security(plugin install)`: install-time signature policy default is
  `warn`.** Now that the trust anchor is real (Fulcio + Rekor) rather
  than a placeholder PEM, `warn` records `signature_status` and logs a
  stderr warning on missing / invalid / untrusted signatures without
  failing the install. Operators wanting fail-closed enforcement opt
  in per-install via `animus plugin install --signature-policy strict
  <repo>`. See
  [`docs/reference/security.md`](docs/reference/security.md#install-time-default-warn).

## [0.4.11] - 2026-05-23

Cleanup + automation hardening. Lands the v0.4.10 Node 24 sweep across the
plugin matrix and promotes the release-automation tooling from "future
work" to "shipped".

### CI

- **`ci`: merged Node 24 PRs across 15 plugin repos (deadline 2026-06-02).**
  Each plugin repo's `chore/force-node24-actions` PR (PR #1, opened in
  v0.4.10) is now landed on `main`. 14 merged clean; `animus-protocol`
  was held back because the existing `cargo fmt` job is failing on a
  pre-existing drift in `animus-plugin-runtime/src/log.rs:241` unrelated
  to the Node 24 env-var change — flagged for v0.4.12.
- **`ci(release-automation)`: add compat-test / validate-manifests /
  check-signatures scripts.** The `launchapp-dev/animus-release-automation`
  repo (shipped in v0.4.10 as v0.1.0 with `matrix.sh` + `cascade.sh`)
  now ships three additional scripts: `compat-test.sh` runs the in-tree
  `orchestrator-plugin-host` `protocol_drift` contract test against each
  plugin's pinned `animus-plugin-protocol` tag; `validate-manifests.sh`
  validates every plugin's `plugin.toml` against `animus.plugin.v1`;
  `check-signatures.sh` audits cosign bundles on each plugin's latest
  release against the `trusted-signers.yaml` defaults. README updated to
  v0.1.1 with usage + dependency notes.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-05-22

Patch release. Picks up v0.4.9 deferrals plus the broader cleanup the user has been queuing — the long-deferred `workflows_list` wire migration (HTTP only), live per-plugin `health/check` RPC fan-out, log redaction wired into every emit site, the two pre-existing flaky tests fixed at the root cause, and a `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` sweep ahead of the 2026-06-02 GitHub Actions Node 20 cutover.

### Breaking Changes

- **`http(workflows_list)`: wire shape on `/api/v1/workflows`.** The HTTP endpoint now serves `WorkflowRunSummary` rows (`id`, `definition`, `status`, `subject_id`, `started_at`, `finished_at`) instead of the full `OrchestratorWorkflow`. Daemon-internal fields (`phases`, `machine_state`, `current_phase`, `checkpoint_metadata`, decision history) no longer leak through the public HTTP API. `status` is kebab-case (`in-progress`-style) on the wire; `Escalated` collapses to `Paused` because the wire status enum lacks the variant. GraphQL `workflows` and `workflowsPaginated` still serve the full `OrchestratorWorkflow` shape, so the embedded web UI is unaffected.

### Features

- **`feat(daemon health)`: live per-plugin `health/check` fan-out.** `daemon_health()` now spawns each discovered plugin one-shot, runs the `initialize` handshake, calls `health/check`, and shuts the plugin down — all under a 3s per-plugin deadline. Probes fire concurrently via `futures_util::future::join_all`, so the wall time is roughly one probe regardless of plugin count. Failures land as `Unhealthy` rows with the error string in `last_error`; the daemon's own status stays `Healthy` because plugin-side trouble is an observability concern, not a daemon-liveness one. A long-lived plugin host pool is still v0.5 work, but `daemon health` is not hot-path enough to need it.
- **`feat(orchestrator-logging)`: redaction wired into `Logger::write_entry`.** The v0.4.9 `redact_log_entry` building block moved from `orchestrator_daemon_runtime::control::log_redact` into `orchestrator_logging::log_redact` and is invoked from `Logger::write_entry` immediately before serialization. Every emit site that goes through the logger picks up redaction automatically; the old module path remains as a re-export so external callers stay source-compatible. New regression test (`write_entry_redacts_msg_in_persisted_line`) reads the persisted `events.jsonl` line and asserts the secret never reached disk.
- **`feat(workflows_list)`: `workflows_list_summary` API method.** New `WebApiService::workflows_list_summary(query)` returns `ListPage<WorkflowRunSummary>` — the projection helper `workflow_to_run_summary` maps local `OrchestratorWorkflow` rows onto the wire shape. The HTTP handler at `/api/v1/workflows` calls this method; the existing `workflows_list` is kept for GraphQL.

### Fixes

- **`fix(tests)`: `plugin_registry_path_falls_back_to_legacy_when_canonical_missing`.** The test was setting `ANIMUS_CONFIG_DIR` to a non-empty path while asserting that `default_config_path()` returns the legacy `~/.config/animus/plugins.yaml`. The `config_dir_overridden` guard in `default_config_path()` intentionally skips the legacy fallback when `ANIMUS_CONFIG_DIR` is set, so the test was actually deterministically failing — but ENV_GUARD poisoning and other tests interacting through the same mutex were masking it as a "flake". The fix explicitly clears `ANIMUS_CONFIG_DIR` for the duration of the test (using the existing `EnvVarGuard`) so the legacy-fallback branch is exercised.
- **`fix(tests)`: `install_succeeds_after_org_added_to_trusted` + 4 siblings.** All five trusted-orgs tests in `ops_plugin` were calling `std::env::set_var("ANIMUS_TRUSTED_ORGS", …)` and `remove_var` bare, with no serialization. Concurrent test threads racing on the same process-global env var were the documented flake source. Fix: new `TRUSTED_ORGS_ENV_GUARD` process-level mutex plus a small `ScopedEnv` RAII helper that restores the prior value on drop (panic-safe). All five tests now serialize through the mutex.

### Plugin Cascade

No plugin-repo cascade in v0.4.10 — `animus-protocol` stays pinned at v0.1.4. The wire shape adopted by item A already lives in v0.1.4, so no protocol bump was required.

### Ops / CI

- **`chore(ci)`: `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` set across all in-tree workflows.** GitHub Actions runners deprecate Node 20 on 2026-06-02; the env var forces JS-based actions onto Node 24 ahead of the cutover. Patched into all 8 `.github/workflows/*.yml` files as a top-level `env:` block.

### Carried Forward

- **Release automation across the 15-repo ecosystem.** Scoping was completed (lighter path: a separate `launchapp-dev/animus-release-automation` repo with a CLI tool that runs the version-pin matrix check + cascade-PR generation), but the implementation work was deferred so the v0.4.10 budget could land items A through F. Filed as the v0.4.11 / v0.5 starting point.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-05-22

Patch release. Picks up v0.4.8 deferrals plus a handful of originally-planned items: the plugin-repo cascade onto animus-protocol v0.1.4, daemon-health per-plugin enumeration, a log redaction layer, and a cleanup pass on the stale `AgentPool` references that have been confusing agent reports for several patches.

### Features

- **`feat(daemon health)`: per-plugin section.** `DaemonHealthResponse` now carries a populated `plugins: Vec<PluginHealth>` whenever the daemon's control wire serves the request: each discovered plugin contributes a `name` / `kind` / `status` row. Live `health/check` RPC fan-out per plugin is intentionally deferred — without a long-lived plugin host pool the daemon would have to one-shot every plugin process per health probe, which is too expensive for a frequently-polled endpoint. The CLI's human renderer prints a compact `plugins:` table when the wire path is taken; the JSON envelope passes the full wire shape through unchanged.
- **`feat(daemon-runtime)`: log redaction layer.** New `orchestrator_daemon_runtime::control::log_redact` module that scrubs secret-shaped values from `LogEntry.msg`, `LogEntry.meta` (recursively over nested JSON), `LogEntry.content`, and `LogEntry.error` before the entry is handed to a storage sink. Default pattern matches `api_key|apikey|api-key|password|token|secret|authorization` followed by `:` or `=` and a value; additional patterns can be appended via `ANIMUS_LOG_REDACT_PATTERNS` (comma-separated regex). Five unit tests cover the default patterns, custom patterns, nested JSON traversal, and the no-op path. The redactor is shipped as a public function — wiring it into every emit path is a v0.4.10 follow-up so the patch boundary stays bounded.

### Plugin Cascade

All 12 plugin repos were re-pinned to animus-protocol v0.1.4 and bumped to their next patch version. The cascade is git-additive: each repo got one `chore: bump to v0.1.x + pin animus-protocol v0.1.4` commit + a new tag, pushed to `main`.

| Repo                              | Old   | New   |
|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|
| animus-subject-linear             | 0.1.2 | 0.1.3 |
| animus-subject-sqlite             | 0.1.2 | 0.1.3 |
| animus-subject-markdown           | 0.1.2 | 0.1.3 |
| animus-subject-requirements       | 0.1.2 | 0.1.3 |
| animus-provider-claude            | 0.1.1 | 0.1.2 |
| animus-provider-codex             | 0.1.1 | 0.1.2 |
| animus-provider-gemini            | 0.1.1 | 0.1.2 |
| animus-provider-opencode          | 0.1.1 | 0.1.2 |
| animus-provider-oai               | 0.1.1 | 0.1.2 |
| animus-trigger-webhook            | 0.1.0 | 0.1.1 |
| animus-trigger-slack              | 0.1.0 | 0.1.1 |
| animus-log-storage-file           | 0.1.0 | 0.1.1 |

The triggers and log-storage repos previously pinned animus-protocol via `branch = "main"`; they now pin `tag = "v0.1.4"` explicitly so the wire surface is reproducible.

### Documentation

- **AgentPool references aligned with reality.** The CLI and daemon-runtime comment blocks claiming "AgentPool carries `#[allow(dead_code)]`" referred to a struct that no longer exists in the tree. Comments in `ops_agent/control_routing.rs` and `control/routing.rs` updated to state plainly: the wire surface stays pass-through because there is no daemon-side agent pool yet, and CLI callers degrade to the local in-process path.

### Deferred to v0.4.10

- **`web-api workflows_list`** continues to return `ListPage<OrchestratorWorkflow>`. Migrating to the wire `WorkflowListResponse` requires both a contract change (pagination model, status casing) and the dropped fields (`phases`, `machine_state`) propagated through the GraphQL surface and downstream typed tests. The web-api crate has stalled multiple agents on this exact migration; held back another patch to keep v0.4.9 from sprawling.
- **Log redaction at every emit site.** v0.4.9 lands the redactor as a public function plus tests. Calling it from `Logger::write_entry` (or from each emit builder) is the next step; the patch ships the building block without changing emit semantics yet.
- **Live `health/check` RPC fan-out per plugin.** Per-plugin status currently reports `Healthy` for any discoverable plugin. Real per-plugin health probes require a long-lived plugin host pool with per-process status caches.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-05-22

Wire + UX patch. Picks up the v0.4.7-deferred web-api work that needed an animus-protocol bump, ships the plugin-runtime structured log macros, and polishes the `animus subject` CLI for the single-backend project case.

### Features

- **`feat(protocol)`: bump animus-protocol to v0.1.4.** `WorkflowResumeRequest` carries an optional `feedback` field so approval-gated workflows can pass reviewer comments through resume. `QueueReorderRequest` accepts a multi-entry form (`subject_ids: Vec<String>`) alongside the single-id shape. `animus-plugin-runtime` ships a new `log` module with crate-level `info!`/`warn!`/`error!`/`debug!`/`trace!` macros that emit `log/entry` JSON-RPC notifications via the existing stdout pipe; each `*_main` entrypoint installs the global emitter automatically.
- **`feat(web-api)`: route `queue/reorder` and `workflow/resume` through the daemon control wire.** With the v0.1.4 wire surface in place, the web-api handlers prefer the daemon's control RPC, falling back to the local path only when the daemon isn't running. `workflow/resume` now carries the reviewer feedback string end-to-end.
- **`feat(cli)`: `animus subject` honors `default_subject_kind` from `.animus/config.json`.** New `--kind` becomes optional; falls back to the config default (which seeds to `"task"` for new projects). Operators can now `animus subject list` without re-typing `--kind task` every invocation. A missing config default *and* missing flag prints a helpful error listing the lookup precedence.
- **`feat(plugin-host)`: hierarchical kind matching in `SubjectRouter`.** Plugins may declare glob kinds like `task.*`; resolution does exact-match first, then longest matching glob prefix. Duplicate equal-prefix globs are rejected at registration time. Five new tests cover the precedence rules.
- **`feat(llm-cli-wrapper)`: typed `Error::CapabilityNotSupported`.** Callers can pattern-match on the typed variant instead of grepping `ExecutionFailed` strings; the cancel-routing path now emits the typed error when a plugin's handshake `capabilities.cancellation` is `false`.

### Removed

- **`test(cli)`: delete the stale `json_success_envelope_contract_is_stable` test.** It still drove `animus task stats`, which was removed in v0.4.4 cleanup, so it had been red on every run since.

### Deferred to v0.4.9

- **`web-api workflows_list`** continues to return `ListPage<OrchestratorWorkflow>` instead of the leaner wire `WorkflowListResponse`. The two shapes differ on pagination model (offset/total vs cursor), status casing (snake_case vs kebab-case), and the wire summary lacks `phases`, `machine_state`, and several other fields the handler currently exposes. Migration is a contract change across `paginated_success_response`, ETag computation, the GraphQL surface, and downstream typed tests.
- **`feat(daemon health)`: per-plugin health.** The brief asked for a `plugins:` section in `animus daemon health` that calls each installed plugin's `health/check` RPC. The plumbing change spans the daemon-runtime health snapshot, the control wire's `daemon/health` response, and CLI rendering — held back to keep the v0.4.8 surface bounded.
- **Plugin repo cascade (10 plugins).** Each subject/provider/trigger/log-storage plugin still pins animus-protocol v0.1.3. The v0.1.4 protocol crate is wire-additive so existing plugins continue to work; per-plugin re-pinning + retagging ships in v0.4.9.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-05-22

Wire-routing patch: the daemon's `daemon/logs` control method finally drives `animus logs tail`, and MCP gets the matching surface. Two of the three deferred web-api handlers stay deferred with v0.4.8-tagged notes; the cross-repo plugin runtime cascade ships in a separate window.

### Features

- **`feat(logs)`: route `animus logs tail` through the control wire when the daemon is up.** Adds `ControlClient::daemon_logs` (streaming consumer with a caller-side limit), wires the daemon's `daemon/logs` surface to read historical entries via the active `LogStorageDispatch`, and updates `ops_logs::handle_logs_tail` so the daemon-up branch no longer opens `events.jsonl` directly. Operators get a single transport regardless of which side is serving; the plugin live-tail path (long-lived `log_storage_backend` plugin host) stays deferred but the contract is now wire-first.
- **`feat(mcp)`: add `animus.logs.tail` tool.** Mirrors the `animus.subject.*` pattern — typed input struct, args builder, `run_tool` shell-out — so agents can pull the daemon's log tail through MCP without re-implementing the wire-fallback logic.

### Deferred to v0.4.8

- **`web-api workflows_list`** keeps returning `ListPage<OrchestratorWorkflow>`. Migrating to the leaner wire `WorkflowListResponse` needs a router + OpenAPI contract change and a GraphQL/web-UI follow-up.
- **`web-api queue_reorder`** stays on the local Vec-of-subject-ids path. Wire `QueueReorderRequest` is single-id + anchor + position; lifting requires a multi-id variant in animus-protocol v0.1.4.
- **`web-api workflows_resume` with feedback** stays local. `WorkflowResumeRequest` lacks a feedback field on the wire; adding it needs an animus-protocol v0.1.4 bump.
- **Plugin runtime `log::{info!, warn!, …}` macros + per-plugin cascade.** Building the `animus_plugin_runtime::log` macros and re-pinning the 10+ subject/provider/trigger/log-storage plugin repos onto v0.1.4 is a separate window.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-05-22

CI workflow cleanup. Two workflows have been failing on every commit since v0.4.1:

- `ci(protocol-drift)`: bump `STANDALONE_TAG` `v0.1.1` → `v0.1.3` to match the in-tree consumer. The workflow was trying to check out a tag that exists on `animus-protocol` but predated the wire-format expansions the in-tree crate now consumes, so the structural-drift assertion fired on every run.
- `ci(release)`: remove the `docker-publish` job. It pushed to `registry.fly.io/ao-daemon`, a registry slug that predates the `ao` → `animus` rename and no longer resolves. Can be re-added when there's a real registry target to point at; GitHub Release binary artifacts (the load-bearing publish path) are unaffected.

No Rust or CLI changes. Pure CI hygiene.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-22

Hotfix release. Two bugs in v0.4.4 + v0.4.3:

- fix(daemon-control): gate Unix-socket server on #[cfg(unix)]
  so Windows release CI compiles. v0.4.2/0.4.3/0.4.4 all failed
  the Windows build for the same reason. Windows now falls back
  to the in-process service path; named-pipe equivalent is a
  future enhancement.
- test: delete 18 cli_e2e tests that exercised v0.4.4-deleted
  commands (animus task / animus requirements lifecycles).
  Unit tests (321/321) cover the new SubjectBackend surface.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-21

Cleanup release that drops the legacy CLI command surfaces v0.4.3 made redundant. The in-tree `SubjectBackend` adapters (`InTreeTaskSubjectBackend`, `InTreeRequirementsSubjectBackend`) plus the external subject_backend plugin ecosystem cover the use cases through the unified `animus subject --kind <kind>` surface.

### Removed

- **`feat(cli)`: delete legacy `animus task` command tree.** Replaced by `animus subject --kind task` against the in-tree task adapter. Underlying `orchestrator-core::services::task*` services are untouched and continue to back both the subject adapter and the daemon's workflow runtime.
- **`feat(cli)`: delete legacy `animus requirements` command tree.** Replaced by `animus subject --kind requirement` against the in-tree requirements adapter. `orchestrator-core::services::requirements*` is preserved.
- **`feat(cli)`: delete legacy `animus cloud` command tree.** Animus-sync legacy surface; cloud sync now ships as an out-of-tree plugin.
- **`feat(cli)`: delete `animus setup` command.** `animus init` is the supported onboarding entry point.
- **`feat(cli)`: delete `animus now` command.** Overlaps with `animus status`; consolidate on the unified status dashboard.
- **`feat(cli)`: delete `animus errors` command tree.** Folded into `animus history`.
- **`feat(mcp)`: delete `ao_task_*` / `animus.task.*` MCP tool family.** Use `animus.subject.*` with `kind=task`.
- **`feat(mcp)`: delete `ao_requirements_*` / `animus.requirements.*` MCP tool family.** Use `animus.subject.*` with `kind=requirement`.
- Companion cleanup: removes the now-unused `shared/parsing.rs` task/requirement value parsers, the `cli_types/shared_types.rs` task/requirement help-text constants, and the `services/runtime/stale_in_progress.rs` summary helpers (only the deleted task handler consumed them).

### Preserved

- `orchestrator-core` services for tasks and requirements stay intact — both the new subject adapters and the daemon's workflow runtime continue to depend on them.
- All other CLI command groups (`daemon`, `agent`, `project`, `queue`, `workflow`, `history`, `git`, `skill`, `model`, `pack`, `plugin`, `runner`, `status`, `output`, `mcp`, `web`, `init`, `doctor`, `trigger`, `logs`, `subject`) are unchanged.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-21

Controller-as-plugin migration plus the daemon-wiring foundation that makes the v0.4.x plugin ecosystem operational. CLI, MCP, and WebAPI all route through the daemon's new Unix-socket control protocol when the daemon is running, falling back to in-process calls when it isn't.

### Features

- **`feat(daemon)`: Unix-socket control server + control protocol.** Daemon now exposes `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/control.sock` (0700 perms) speaking newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 per [`animus-control-protocol` v0.1.3](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-protocol/tree/v0.1.3/animus-control-protocol). 47 method constants across 7 groups (subject, plugin, daemon, workflow, agent, queue, project). Auto-starts at daemon launch; opt-out via `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_CONTROL_SERVER=1`. Emits `DaemonRunEvent::ControlServerResolved` so operators can find the socket path in `events.jsonl`.
- **`feat(cli)`: every command tries the control socket first, falls back to local.** `animus plugin/daemon/workflow/queue/agent/subject` commands open the control socket when present and route through it; one-shot operations (no daemon) keep working via the existing in-process path. Preserves the `animus.cli.v1` JSON envelope on both paths.
- **`feat(mcp)`: tool surface routes through control protocol via CLI subprocess.** `ao_workflow_*`, `ao_queue_*`, `ao_plugin_*`, `ao_daemon_*`, and `ao_agent_*` MCP tools shell out to the migrated CLI, which routes via control when the daemon is up. Six new `animus.subject.*` MCP tools added (list, get, create, update, next, status) to mirror the CLI surface.
- **`feat(web-api)`: REST handlers route through control protocol (9 of 12 migrated).** `queue_list`, `queue_stats`, `queue_hold`, `queue_release`, `workflows_get`, `workflows_run`, `workflows_pause`, `workflows_resume`, `workflows_cancel` all try control first, fall back to direct `ServiceHub` calls. Deferred: `workflows_list`, `queue_reorder`, `workflows_resume` with feedback — wire-shape contract changes pending.
- **`feat(daemon-logs)`: LogStorageBackend plugin discovery + `animus logs tail`.** Daemon discovers installed `log_storage_backend` plugins at startup; if exactly one is found, it becomes the active log sink. Falls back to the in-tree `Logger` writing `events.jsonl` when no plugin is installed. New `animus logs tail [--plugin] [--level] [--since] [--follow] [--json]` CLI reads from whichever backend is active. Opt-out via `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_LOG_STORAGE_PLUGIN=1`.
- **`feat(daemon-subject)`: SubjectBackend plugin discovery + `animus subject` CLI.** Daemon discovers installed `subject_backend` plugins, builds the `SubjectRouter` from their declared `subject_kinds`, rejects duplicate-kind claims at startup. Generic `animus subject list/get/create/update/next/status --kind <kind>` routes through whichever plugin owns that kind. Built-in `InTreeTaskSubjectBackend` + `InTreeRequirementsSubjectBackend` auto-register under `kind=task` and `kind=requirement` so legacy `animus task` and `animus requirements` keep working unchanged.

### Refactors

- **`refactor(control)`: relocate `ControlClient` to `orchestrator-daemon-runtime`.** Lived in `orchestrator-cli` originally; `orchestrator-web-api` couldn't depend on it (circular). Moved to the daemon-runtime crate which both already depend on. No behavior change; mechanical import updates across the CLI.
- **`refactor(plugin-runtime)`: subject dispatch accepts `<kind>/<verb>` method names.** Aligns the runtime's dispatch table with the daemon's `SubjectRouter` kind-keyed routing. Shipped as [`animus-protocol` v0.1.2](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-protocol/tree/v0.1.2); subject plugin repos (linear, sqlite, markdown, requirements) cut v0.1.2 to consume it.

### Deferred to v0.4.x patches

- Legacy CLI command deletion (`Command::Task`, `Command::Requirements`, hidden `Review`, `Qa`) plus matching MCP tools (`ao_task_*`, `ao_requirements_*`). The in-tree task/requirements services keep working via the new SubjectBackend adapters; deletion is a follow-up cleanup commit. (Shipped in v0.4.4.)
- `workflows_list` web-api migration (router + OpenAPI contract change required)
- `queue_reorder` web-api migration (multi-id wire support needed)
- TTL eviction for the session-keyed host cache (deferred from the cancel-keep-host-alive MVP)
- AgentPool integration (still `allow(dead_code)`) — agent dispatch returns `NotSupported` over the control wire pending the daemon-side query surface

## [0.4.2] previously listed Unreleased features (now formally released)

- **`feat(plugin)`: cosign signature verification on plugin install.** `animus plugin install <owner/repo>` now checks for a [sigstore cosign](https://www.sigstore.dev) signature bundle (`<asset>.tar.gz.bundle`) alongside the binary asset. When present, the install verifies it via the `cosign` CLI (shell-out for v0.4.x; in-process `sigstore-rs` planned for v0.5+). Default mode: verify-if-present and record `signature_status: verified|unsigned` in `~/.animus/plugins.yaml`. New flags: `--require-signature` refuses install when no bundle is published or verification fails; `--skip-signature` bypasses verification entirely; `--trusted-signers <PATH>` points at a YAML allowlist (default `~/.animus/trusted-signers.yaml`). A FAILING signature always refuses install. The `cosign` binary is a soft dependency — when missing, installs degrade to `signature_status: unsigned` rather than failing. `animus plugin list` gains a `SIG` column surfacing the recorded status. Plugin release workflows (`launchapp-dev/animus-*`) ship signing as of plugin tag `v0.1.2+` via GitHub Actions OIDC (no secrets to manage). See [docs/architecture/plugin-signing.md](docs/architecture/plugin-signing.md).
- **`feat(workflow-config)`: `${VAR}` env-var interpolation in workflow YAML.** `.animus/workflows.yaml`, `.animus/workflows/*.yaml`, and pack-shipped workflow overlays now support shell-style `${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}`, and `${VAR:?error}` interpolation. Substitution runs before YAML parsing so every string scalar — subject backend configs, provider tokens, MCP `env` blocks, phase env overrides — accepts the same syntax uniformly. Unset required vars fail fast with the YAML file path + line number. Use `$$` to embed a literal `$`. Recommended for non-secret config like team IDs, base URLs, and feature flags; credentials still belong in the daemon's process environment, not in YAML. See [docs/reference/configuration.md](docs/reference/configuration.md#workflow-yaml-interpolation-non-secret-config).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-17

Same-day follow-up to v0.4.1. Ships the full v0.4.0 plugin ecosystem: every
provider plugin promised by the v0.4.0 release is now live in its own
`launchapp-dev/animus-*` repository with green CI, alongside the protocol
crates, a public plugin scaffold template, and the first subject backend
(Linear). The in-tree CLI gains the matching `animus plugin install
<owner/repo>` and `animus plugin new` surfaces for one-command install +
bootstrap, and several rough edges in `animus init` and plugin discovery
caught during release verification are fixed.

### Plugin ecosystem (now shipped, was "in-flight" in v0.4.0 notes)

Eight standalone repositories under [launchapp-dev](https://github.com/launchapp-dev),
each tagged `v0.1.0` with green CI:

- [`animus-protocol`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-protocol) — 5-crate workspace publishing `animus-plugin-protocol`, `animus-subject-protocol`, `animus-provider-protocol`, `animus-plugin-runtime`, and `animus-session-backend`. CI workflow added.
- [`animus-plugin-template`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-plugin-template) — subject + provider scaffolds consumed by `animus plugin new`. CI workflow runs `cargo check` against both kinds on every push.
- [`animus-subject-linear`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-subject-linear) — Linear GraphQL `SubjectBackend` reference implementation. Credentials load leniently so `--manifest` probes work credential-free.
- [`animus-provider-claude`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-provider-claude) — Claude Code CLI wrapper provider.
- [`animus-provider-codex`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-provider-codex) — Codex CLI wrapper provider.
- [`animus-provider-gemini`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-provider-gemini) — Gemini CLI wrapper provider.
- [`animus-provider-opencode`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-provider-opencode) — OpenCode CLI wrapper provider.
- [`animus-provider-oai`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-provider-oai) — OpenAI-compatible HTTP provider. Lenient credential loading so `--manifest` works without a configured API key.

### Features

- **`animus plugin install <owner/repo>[@tag]`**: Install a plugin directly from a public GitHub release. The CLI resolves the latest release (or the supplied tag), downloads the matching architecture asset, verifies the published checksum, drops the binary into `~/.animus/plugins/`, and registers it in `~/.animus/plugins.yaml`. Mutually exclusive with `--path` / `--url`. New `--tag <TAG>` and `--latest` flags make scripted installs explicit. Local-file (`--path`) and direct-URL (`--url --sha256`) installs from v0.4.0 still work unchanged.
- **`animus plugin new --kind <subject|provider|trigger> --name <name>`**: Scaffold a brand-new plugin project from `launchapp-dev/animus-plugin-template`. Clones the template (or reads `--template-path <PATH>` for offline use), substitutes the per-kind/per-name variables, and writes a buildable Rust project to `./animus-<kind>-<name>/` (override with `--out-dir`). The output project is `cargo build`-clean from the first commit.
- **Plugin install dir is configurable**: New `--plugin-dir <PATH>` flag on `animus plugin install` / `uninstall`, plus the new `$ANIMUS_PLUGIN_DIR` env var, override the default `~/.animus/plugins/` location. Discovery scans the same directory automatically.
- **Plugin registry consolidated under `~/.animus/`**: The plugin registry file moves from `~/.config/animus/plugins.yaml` to `~/.animus/plugins.yaml`. The legacy path is still read transparently on first run; the next `animus plugin install` rewrites it to the new location. Two new helpers (`plugins_registry_path()` and `legacy_plugins_registry_path()`) are re-exported from `orchestrator-plugin-host` for tooling that needs to point at either.

### Fixes

- **`animus init` no longer emits legacy wrapper YAMLs alongside template files** (commit [`f7c85a11`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-cli/commit/f7c85a11), bug #22): `animus init --template task-queue` was writing both the registry's inline-content workflow files *and* three hardcoded wrapper YAMLs (`standard-workflow.yaml`, `hotfix-workflow.yaml`, `research-workflow.yaml`) because `FileServiceHub::new` ran the hardcoded scaffold inside `bootstrap_project_base_configs` *before* `write_template_files` had a chance to drop registry files. Reorder: write template files first, bootstrap second. The scaffold's `has_existing_yaml` short-circuit now sees the registry files and skips the wrappers. Also fixes an undercount of three in `apply.written_files` because the scaffold was writing outside the tracked path. Verified: a fresh `animus init --non-interactive --template task-queue` now produces 5 YAML files (was 8).
- **Plugin discovery surfaces failed-manifest probes instead of silent-dropping them** (commit [`8394a73`](https://github.com/launchapp-dev/animus-cli/commit/8394a73)): `discover_configured` and `scan_dir` were swallowing manifest-fetch errors, so installed plugins that failed `--manifest` invocation (the symptom: `animus-provider-oai` before the lenient-credential fix) silently disappeared from `animus plugin list` with no diagnostic. New `DiscoveryWarning` struct + `PluginDiscovery::discover_with_warnings()` API returns failed-probe plugins alongside successes, with the binary's stderr + exit code included. `tracing::warn!` fires at every drop site. `animus plugin list --json` gains a top-level `warnings` array; human output prints each warning to stderr. The `animus.plugin.list` MCP tool result gains a parallel `warnings` field. Regression tests cover failed `--manifest` probes for explicit-config plugins, missing configured binaries, and failed `scan_dir` manifest probes.
- **`animus-provider-oai --manifest` works credential-free** (shipped in `animus-provider-oai` v0.1.0): Manifest probes no longer require `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set. The lenient-config loader returns a manifest with an `error` capability hint when credentials are missing, instead of exiting with code 1.
- **`animus-subject-linear --manifest` works credential-free** (shipped in `animus-subject-linear` v0.1.0): Same fix as the oai provider — credential validation deferred from `--manifest` to the first `subject/list` call.

### CI

- **`animus-protocol` repo now has CI**: `cargo check` + `cargo test` across the 5-crate workspace on every push.
- **`animus-plugin-template` repo now has CI**: Validates both the subject scaffold and the provider scaffold compile cleanly via `cargo check`.

### Docs

- **`README.md` + `CLAUDE.md` drop "extraction in progress" framing**: Both update to describe the shipped 22-crate workspace plus the 8 standalone plugin repositories under [launchapp-dev](https://github.com/launchapp-dev). The CLAUDE.md "Current Baseline" section now reflects v0.4.0 plugin extraction as complete rather than in flux.
- **`docs/migration/v0.3-to-v0.4.md` marked complete**: Migration guide now documents the actual shipped install surfaces (public-repo `owner/repo@tag`, local `--path`, URL `--url --sha256`, and scaffold via `animus plugin new`) rather than describing them as planned.
- **`docs/reference/cli/index.md`**: Adds the `animus plugin install <owner/repo>` and `animus plugin new` flag surfaces, the new `--plugin-dir` override, and the updated default registry path. Discovery-order line updated to point at `~/.animus/plugins.yaml`.
- **`docs/architecture/subject-backend-plugins.md`**: Resolves the v0.4.0 "open questions" section against the v0.1.0 protocol shape that actually shipped. Adds links to the live `animus-protocol` and `animus-subject-linear` repositories.

### Known follow-ups (deferred to v0.4.x)

- `[[bin]] name = "ao-workflow-runner"` in `crates/workflow-runner-v2/Cargo.toml` is still the legacy bin name (from v0.4.1 known-follow-ups list; not yet renamed).
- Release archive filenames still use the `ao-v0.4.X-` prefix; the release script's archive-naming convention still needs to be updated to `animus-v0.4.X-`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-17

Same-day patch for issues caught during v0.4.0 release verification.

### Fixes
- **Plugin discovery config path renamed**: `default_config_path()` in `crates/orchestrator-plugin-host/src/discovery.rs:174` previously read `~/.config/ao/plugins.yaml` — a stale path the v0.4.0 hard rename missed. v0.4.1 reads from `~/.config/animus/plugins.yaml`. Users with a config at the old path need to `mv ~/.config/ao ~/.config/animus` on upgrade.
- **Docker image build broken upstream**: the v0.4.0 Release Binaries workflow's Docker step failed because OpenCode upstream changed its release-asset format from `opencode_linux_${ARCH}` (single binary) to `opencode-linux-${ARCH}.tar.gz` (tarball). Animus's `Dockerfile` now pulls the tarball and extracts the `opencode` binary out of it.
- **Docker stack finished rename**: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` both had leftover `ao` references the rename missed — `mkdir -p /root/.ao` → `mkdir -p /root/.animus`, compose service name `ao` → `animus`, image `ghcr.io/launchapp-dev/ao:latest` → `ghcr.io/launchapp-dev/animus:latest`, volume `ao-data:/root/.ao` → `animus-data:/root/.animus`, entrypoint `ao` → `animus`.

### Docs
- **Reference docs cover the v0.4.0 MCP surface**: `docs/reference/mcp-tools.md` now documents the `animus.skill.{list,get,search}` and `animus.memory.{get,list,append,clear}` families, including the `capabilities.memory: true` gating model. `docs/reference/cli/index.md` gets a "Selected Command Flags" section covering `animus init --update-registry`, the SHA256-required-with-URL plugin install rule, and the `--include-system-path` opt-in. `docs/reference/configuration.md` env var table expanded from 4 to ~30 entries. `docs/reference/data-layout.md` covers the new `~/.animus/packs/`, agent-host skill probe paths, and the resolution-paths table grew from 7 to 14 entries.
- **Narrative-docs `AO` / `ao` prose sweep**: 49 docs across `docs/{design,concepts,guides,architecture,contributing,reference,internals}/` plus the VitePress site config had bare project-name mentions of `AO` / `ao` that survived sub-agent A's code-focused rename. All now read `Animus`. Also folded into this pass: stale crate counts (`17-crate workspace` → `Rust-only Cargo workspace (around 20 crates)`), stale literal command examples (`ao status`, `ao now`, `ao git`, etc.), branch prefix `ao/<task-id>` → `animus/<task-id>` in `docs/concepts/worktrees.md` to match `crates/orchestrator-git-ops/src/daemon_git_worktree.rs`, and stale `PROJECT_ROOT` env var fallback in `docs/reference/cli/global-flags.md` per CLAUDE.md guidance.

### Known follow-ups (deferred to v0.4.x)
- `[[bin]] name = "ao-workflow-runner"` in `crates/workflow-runner-v2/Cargo.toml` is still the legacy bin name. Rename pending.
- Release archive filenames still use the `ao-v0.4.X-` prefix (e.g. `ao-v0.4.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`). The release script's archive-naming convention needs to be updated to `animus-v0.4.X-`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-14

This is a major release and the v0.3.x → v0.4.0 break is intentionally large. Three commitments land together:

1. **One name across every surface.** The partial v0.3.x rebrand from AO to Animus is finished. There is no longer an `ao.*` namespace. Every MCP tool, environment variable, configuration directory, pack id, JSON envelope, plugin crate, and standalone plugin repository uses the `animus` name. No deprecation aliases. See the [naming contract](docs/architecture/naming-contract.md) and [migration guide](docs/migration/v0.3-to-v0.4.md).
2. **The architecture commits to plugin-first.** Subjects (units of dispatchable work) are now pluggable so teams can keep using Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues / Notion as their source of truth. Provider plugins (Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenAI-compatible, OpenCode) move from in-tree workspace crates to standalone repositories. The plugin protocol crates move to a dedicated `launchapp-dev/animus-protocol` repository and ship as published Rust SDK crates that any plugin author depends on.
3. **The skill system rearchitects around the ecosystem-standard SKILL.md format.** Bundled YAML skills become an installable `animus.core-skills` pack. Skills installed for other agent hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode) become discoverable subject sources for Animus workflows.

Expect breaking changes throughout. The migration is small in absolute terms because the v0.3.x install base is small; the rename is a deliberate inflection point that commits to Animus as an ecosystem rather than a single tool.

### Breaking changes

- **Full rename to `animus` (no aliases).** Every `ao.*` MCP tool name becomes `animus.*` (58 tools). Every `AO_*` environment variable becomes `ANIMUS_*` (51 vars). The project-local config directory `.ao/` becomes `.animus/`. Scoped runtime state at `~/.ao/<repo-scope>/` moves to `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/`. Pack ids `ao.task` / `ao.review` / `ao.requirement` become `animus.task` / `animus.review` / `animus.requirement`. The JSON output envelope schema `ao.cli.v1` becomes `animus.cli.v1`. The plugin protocol host name `"ao"` becomes `"animus"`. The in-tree provider crates rename from `ao-provider-*` to `animus-provider-*`; `ao-plugin-smoke` becomes `animus-plugin-smoke`. The migration guide has the complete list with before/after examples.
- **Bundled YAML skills moved to an installable pack.** `BUILTIN_SKILL_YAMLS` is removed. The 19 skills that previously shipped baked into the binary are now distributed as the `animus.core-skills` pack, auto-installed during `animus init` / `animus setup`. Existing references resolve via the `Installed` source.
- **`animus plugin install --url <url>` now requires `--sha256`.** Previously optional; URL-sourced installs without an integrity check are rejected at the CLI layer.
- **Plugin discovery no longer scans `$PATH` by default.** Discovery is limited to `.animus/plugins/` and `$ANIMUS_PLUGIN_PATH`. Restoring the prior behavior requires explicit `--include-system-path` on the discovery surface.
- **SKILL.md frontmatter: Animus-specific fields move under a vendor namespace.** `tool_policy`, `extra_args`, `env`, `mcp_servers`, `adapters`, `codex_config_overrides` move from top-level frontmatter to `animus:` in the SKILL.md frontmatter. Keeps SKILL.md portable across the ecosystem (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, gstack) by isolating Animus-specific fields.
- **Subjects are now pluggable.** Native `animus task` is one backend among many. Workflows can declare `subject_type:` to operate over Linear/Jira/GitHub Issues subjects via plugin backends. Existing workflows that omit `subject_type:` continue using the native task backend with no change.
- **Plugin protocol crates move to standalone repository.** `orchestrator-plugin-protocol` is replaced by `animus-plugin-protocol` published from `launchapp-dev/animus-protocol`. The new `animus-subject-protocol`, `animus-provider-protocol`, and `animus-plugin-runtime` crates also publish from that repository. Plugin authors depend on these crates from crates.io rather than path-depending on the core workspace.
- **Provider plugins move to standalone repositories.** `animus-provider-{claude, codex, gemini, oai, opencode}` each ship from their own repository under `launchapp-dev/`. The daemon image installs them at build time from crates.io.

### Architectural commitments (documented for the first time)

- **Naming**: one name everywhere. See [naming contract](docs/architecture/naming-contract.md).
- **Plugin-first architecture**: subjects, providers, triggers, and skills are all plugins. The core is the orchestration runtime; plugins are independent release artifacts. See [subject backend plugins](docs/architecture/subject-backend-plugins.md).
- **Standalone plugin repositories**: every plugin lives in its own GitHub repository under `launchapp-dev/animus-{kind}-{name}`. The repository name, crate name, and binary name all match. Plugin authors generate new plugins from the `animus-plugin-template` scaffold via `animus plugin new --kind <kind> --name <name>`.

### Features

#### Plugin host
- **Stdio plugin host foundation**: New `orchestrator-plugin-host` (in core) plus `animus-plugin-protocol` (extracted to `launchapp-dev/animus-protocol`) implement newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 plugin protocol with handshake, request/response, notifications, and streaming over stdio.
- **Plugin host wired through the runtime**: CLI, MCP server, subject dispatch, and daemon all route through the new plugin host. New `animus plugin install/list/get` commands and `animus.plugin.*` MCP tools.
- **Claude and Codex shipped as stdio plugins**: First-class `animus-provider-claude` and `animus-provider-codex` provider plugins running over the new protocol, distributed from their own repositories.
- **Three additional providers plus mock + runtime**: `animus-provider-gemini`, `animus-provider-opencode`, `animus-provider-oai`, plus the in-tree `animus-provider-mock` (testing) and the shared `animus-plugin-runtime` crate (used by every provider for the RPC loop, streaming, and logging).
- **Plugin smoke test**: `animus-plugin-smoke` crate exercises the end-to-end plugin contract for CI.
- **Subject backend plugins**: New `animus-subject-protocol` defines the `SubjectBackend` trait + normalized Subject schema. First reference implementation: `animus-subject-linear` ships from its own repository. The `animus plugin new` scaffold + `animus-plugin-template` make new subject backends a single-command bootstrap.
- **Template-driven `animus init`**: External template registry (default `launchapp-dev/animus-project-templates`) cloned and cached under `~/.animus/template-registries/<registry-id>/`. Three bundled templates: `task-queue`, `conductor`, `direct-workflow`. Flags: `--template <id>`, `--path <local-dir>`, `--non-interactive`, `--force`, `--update-registry`.
- **Template registry commit pinning**: `animus init` captures the registry HEAD on first clone into `.commit` metadata and refuses to silently fast-forward on subsequent runs. Use `--update-registry` to fetch latest and re-pin.
- **Bootstrap packs externalized**: Templates carry `[[packs]]` declarations that activate during init (e.g. `animus.task`, `animus.requirement`).
- **Markdown skill installs**: `animus skill install` supports SKILL.md format (frontmatter + body) alongside YAML. Body content lands in `prompt.system`. Animus-specific runtime fields live under the `animus:` frontmatter namespace.
- **Agent memory and communication config**: New per-agent memory state plus inter-agent messaging plumbed into phase prompt rendering. Memory MCP tools (`animus.memory.{get, list, append, clear}`) capability-gated on `agent.capabilities.memory == true`.
- **Plugin streaming + structured logging**: Provider RPC loop streams chunks back over notifications; structured logs flow to the host stderr sink.
- **`animus plugin install --url <https-url>`**: Download a plugin binary from an HTTPS URL with mandatory SHA256 integrity verification.

#### Subject backend protocol (v0.4.0 plugin extraction)
- **`animus-subject-protocol` crate**: New workspace crate (also published from `launchapp-dev/animus-protocol`) defining the `SubjectBackend` trait, normalized `Subject` schema (`SubjectId`, `SubjectStatus`, `SubjectFilter`, `SubjectList`, `SubjectPatch`, `SubjectSchema`, `ChangeKind`, `SubjectChangedEvent`), and JSON-RPC method constants (`subject/list`, `subject/get`, `subject/update`, `subject/watch`, `subject/schema`).
- **`animus-provider-protocol` crate**: New workspace crate defining the `ProviderBackend` trait, `AgentRunRequest`/`AgentRunResponse`/`AgentResumeRequest`/`AgentCancelRequest`/`ProviderManifest`/`ProviderCapabilities`/`TokenUsage` types, and `BackendError` with structured RPC error mapping.
- **`animus-plugin-runtime`**: Generalized from `ao-provider-runtime`. Provides `subject_backend_main()` and `provider_main()` entry points, full stdin/stdout JSON-RPC loop, lifecycle method handling (initialize/initialized/$/ping/shutdown/exit/health/check), and the `animus:` shape future plugin authors target.
- **Subject backend design doc**: `docs/architecture/subject-backend-plugins.md` defines the v0.4.0 plugin contract — `SubjectBackend` trait, normalized schema, JSON-RPC method set, workflow YAML binding, native `animus task` migration plan, and 8 open questions for red-team.

#### Skill system rearchitect
- **`animus.core-skills` pack**: The 19 bundled YAML skills now ship as an installable pack at `crates/orchestrator-config/config/bundled-packs/animus.core-skills/`. Auto-installs during `animus init` and `animus setup` and pins itself in `.animus/state/pack-selection.v1.json`. Users can `cd ~/.animus/packs/animus.core-skills/0.1.0/skills/` to read, fork, or override any of the 27 catalog skill names. Pack updates ship via `animus skill install` — no binary upgrade required.
- **`PackManifest::workflows` is now optional**: Skills-only packs are first-class. Validation requires at least one of `[workflows]` or `[skills]`. `PackSkills` is a sibling to `PackWorkflows`.
- **`SkillSourceOrigin::AgentHost { host, scope }`**: New variant scans skills installed for other agent hosts. Six hosts wired via `AGENT_HOST_SPECS`: Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/`, `<project>/.claude/skills/`), Codex (`~/.codex/skills/`), OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/skills/`), Cursor (`~/.cursor/skills/`), Kiro (`~/.kiro/skills/`), Slate (`~/.slate/skills/`). Project-scoped variants take precedence over global. Each scope is `Project | Global`.
- **Two-tier trust model**: `strip_structural_fields_for_agent_host` removes `tool_policy`, `extra_args`, `env`, `mcp_servers`, `adapters`, `codex_config_overrides`, and `capabilities` from any AgentHost-discovered skill at parse time. AgentHost skills can only contribute prompt text + directives. To use a host-discovered skill's full structural fields, the user must explicitly run `animus skill install --path` to promote it to the high-trust `Installed` source.
- **`animus:` vendor namespace in SKILL.md frontmatter**: Animus-specific runtime fields (`tool_policy`, `mcp_servers`, `model.preferred`, `adapters`, etc.) now live under `animus:` in the SKILL.md frontmatter, keeping SKILL.md portable across other agent hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, gstack) that don't recognize Animus-specific keys. Top-level placement of these fields is no longer parsed (hard cut, no deprecation warning). The trust strip still applies even when `animus:` namespace is present in an AgentHost source.
- **Source chain priority**: `AgentHost::Global < AgentHost::Project < Builtin < Installed (pack + registry) < User < Project`. `load_skill_sources` returns sources in lowest-to-highest order; resolution iterates in reverse for highest-priority match.
- **`docs/architecture/skill-system.md`**: New design doc covering the source chain, trust tiers, vendor namespace, and `animus.core-skills` pack layout.

#### `animus.skill.*` MCP tools
- **`animus.skill.list`**: Enumerate all skills across every source (Builtin, Installed, AgentHost::Project, AgentHost::Global, User, Project). Each entry carries `source` (variant tag) + `source_detail` with provenance: registry/source/version for Installed; host/scope plus `structural_fields_stripped: true` and `trust_tier: "prompt_text_only"` for AgentHost. Optional `source` filter (`builtin`, `installed`, `agent_host`, or a host id like `claude-code`).
- **`animus.skill.get`**: Fetch the full `SkillDefinition` for a skill by name. AgentHost-source responses include a `notice` field explaining that structural fields were stripped at parse time.
- **`animus.skill.search`**: Case-insensitive substring match over name, description, and tags. Optional source filter and result limit.

External agents (Claude Code session driving Animus, workflow-spawned subprocesses connected over MCP) can now discover the skill catalog at runtime — including the user's existing `~/.claude/skills/` library that v0.3.x couldn't reach — without shelling out to `animus skill list --json` or hardcoding skill names.

### Fixes
- **Honor configured rework routing** (#024f0161): `rework` verdicts now respect the configured routing target instead of defaulting to the immediately preceding phase.
- **Plugin handshake hangs blocked**: `PluginHost::handshake` now wraps the initialize round trip in a 30-second timeout so a non-responsive plugin can't deadlock daemon startup.
- **`expect()` panics removed from plugin code paths**: `animus.plugin.call` MCP tool and the provider runtime's `initialize` / `health/check` paths now return structured RPC errors instead of panicking when serialization or registry initialization fails.
- **`git clone` / `git pull` errors surfaced**: Template registry sync now captures stdout/stderr from git subprocess invocations and includes them in error messages (was previously swallowed).

### Docs
- **Naming contract**: `docs/architecture/naming-contract.md` commits to one name across every surface (Animus). Cross-linked from architecture index, VitePress nav, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Subject backend plugin protocol**: `docs/architecture/subject-backend-plugins.md` defines the v0.4.0 subject backend plugin design.
- **Skill system v0.4.0**: `docs/architecture/skill-system.md` — source chain, trust tiers, `animus:` namespace, `animus.core-skills` pack layout.
- **Migration guide**: `docs/migration/v0.3-to-v0.4.md` walks through every breaking change with before/after examples covering all 14 surfaces (rename, plugin discovery, template registry pinning, skill system, subject backend pluggability).
- **`feature-status.md`**: Template-driven project init flipped from In-Flight to Shipped.
- **`docs/architecture/index.md`**: Updated to reflect the all-`animus` naming, the ~20-crate workspace size, and the v0.4.0 subject backend plugin link.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (project guide): Updated state paths from `.ao/` → `.animus/`, env var references from `AO_*` → `ANIMUS_*`, and the working-rules naming guidance to the all-`animus` model.

### Internal
- **Cargo aliases renamed**: `cargo ao-fmt`/`ao-lint`/`ao-bin-build`/`ao-bin-check` → `cargo animus-fmt`/`animus-lint`/`animus-bin-build`/`animus-bin-check`. CI release workflow updated.

### Known issues / fix-before-tag
- Plugin discovery executes `--manifest` on every candidate found in `.animus/plugins/` and `$ANIMUS_PLUGIN_PATH` with no signature, allowlist, or sandboxing. `$PATH` is opt-in (off by default). Treat the install / discovery surface as trusted-only until a richer trust model lands.
- Subject backend reference plugin (`animus-subject-linear`) and `animus plugin new` scaffold command are still on the v0.4.0 roadmap; the protocol crate stack is in place to support them. Native `animus task` migration to satisfy the `SubjectBackend` trait also remains pending.
- The optional `animus.skill.registry.list` MCP tool was deferred — `SkillRegistrySourceConfig` is `pub(super)` to `ops_skill` and exposing it cleanly needs a thin `pub fn list_skill_registries()` accessor first. Follow-up.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixes
- **Default decision contract evidence types** (TASK-222): Implementation phase decision contract now accepts the common evidence kinds agents actually return (`bug_confirmed`, `fix_identified`, etc.), not only `files_modified`. First workflow runs no longer fail immediately when an agent does an analysis-only pass.
- **`phase_decision.evidence` is now optional** when no required evidence types are configured.
- **Strip secrets from tracked state**: Removed `.ao/sync.json` from tracking; it can contain auth tokens.
- **Rustfmt + lint cleanups**: `runtime_contract.rs` method chain and test formatting.

### Features
- **`animus task status --force`**: Allow forced status transitions for skip/cancel paths.
- **Surface agent file-edit decisions**: When an agent runs an analysis phase and modifies no files, the phase output now explains why (permissions, working directory, prompt constraints, or "no change needed") instead of leaving the user guessing.

### Docs
- Restructured getting-started to lead with autonomous mode.
- README updated with v0.3.0 feature surface.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-07

### Features
- **Animus daemon Docker image**: Multi-stage `Dockerfile` produces a `linux/amd64` image with minimal dependencies, sized for Fly.io cloud deployment.
- **Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode bundled in the daemon image**: The cloud daemon ships with all three coding CLIs pre-installed so spawned workflow agents work without per-tenant install steps.
- **Docker image publish in release workflow**: CI now pushes `registry.fly.io/ao-daemon` on tagged releases.

### Fixes
- **Auto-start daemon and agent-runner on sync workflow execution** (TASK-221): Fixes "first-run socket error" when invoking a sync workflow without a daemon already running.
- **Dockerfile Rust bump to 1.89**: `async-graphql` requires rustc 1.89+.
