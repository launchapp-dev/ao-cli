# Animus - Coding Agent Guide

This file is the current working brief for AI coding agents operating in this repo.
If a statement here conflicts with source, update the docs and follow source.

For the v0.4.0 naming + plugin extraction, see [docs/architecture/naming-contract.md](docs/architecture/naming-contract.md), [docs/architecture/subject-backend-plugins.md](docs/architecture/subject-backend-plugins.md), and the migration guide at [docs/migration/v0.3-to-v0.4.md](docs/migration/v0.3-to-v0.4.md).

## Verify Before Repeating

This repo has had stale prose before. Verify against these files before restating
architecture, command counts, routes, or state paths:

- `Cargo.toml`
- `docs/reference/cli/index.md`
- `docs/reference/mcp-tools.md`
- `crates/orchestrator-cli/src/cli_types/root_types.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/config.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/services.rs`
- `crates/protocol/src/config.rs`
- `crates/protocol/src/repository_scope.rs`

## Current Baseline

Animus is a Rust-only agent orchestrator with:

- a Cargo workspace of around 12 first-class crates (`crates/` currently lists 21 directory entries; the extras are protocol shims, the in-tree plugin runtime, and test-fixture plugins such as `animus-plugin-smoke` and `animus-provider-mock`)
- the CLI binary named `animus`
- a visible CLI surface that includes `project` and `queue`
- scoped runtime state under `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/`
- project-local workflow YAML overlays under `.animus/workflows.yaml` or `.animus/workflows/*.yaml`
- the web UI now ships as the standalone `launchapp-dev/animus-web-ui` plugin (paired with `animus-transport-http` + `animus-transport-graphql`); the in-tree `orchestrator-web-server` / `orchestrator-web-api` / `orchestrator-web-contracts` crates were removed in v0.4.12
- a stdio plugin host (`orchestrator-plugin-host`) for subject, provider, transport, and trigger plugins, plus a typed `HostError::ConnectionLost` + `classify(&HostError) -> RetryDecision` API for supervised restart decisions
- a daemon-side workflow event broadcaster that emits `phase_started` / `phase_completed` / `workflow_completed` / `workflow_failed` on the `workflow/events` ControlClient subscription (animus-protocol v0.1.10)
- the v0.4.x plugin extraction **complete**: 18 standalone repositories live at <https://github.com/launchapp-dev> covering protocol, providers (claude / codex / gemini / opencode / oai), subject backends (default / requirements / linear / sqlite / markdown), transports (http / graphql), web UI, triggers (webhook / slack), log storage, the conformance testkit, the release-automation scripts, and the plugin template. Only `animus-provider-mock` and `animus-plugin-smoke` remain in-tree, as test fixtures.

Do not reintroduce stale claims such as:

- 9-, 10-, or 22-crate workspace summaries (the post-deletion baseline is ~12)
- "plugin extraction in flux" or "in progress" framing — extraction is complete as of v0.4.12
- `PROJECT_ROOT` or "last-project-root registry" resolution rules
- removed crates like `llm-mcp-server`, `llm-cli-wrapper`, `orchestrator-web-server`, `orchestrator-web-api`, `orchestrator-web-contracts`, or in-tree `animus-provider-{claude,codex,gemini,opencode,oai}`
- outdated CLI groups such as a top-level `planning` facade
- in-tree `inproc_subject_backend.rs` or the `InTreeTaskSubjectBackend` / `InTreeRequirementsSubjectBackend` adapters — all subject ops route through the `SubjectRouter` to installed plugins
- claims that `animus web serve` boots an in-process axum server — it now spawns installed transport + web_ui plugins

## Workspace Map

Core orchestration:

- `crates/orchestrator-cli`
- `crates/orchestrator-core`
- `crates/orchestrator-config`
- `crates/orchestrator-store`
- `crates/protocol`

Runtime and provider layer:

- `crates/agent-runner`
- `crates/oai-runner`
- `crates/workflow-runner-v2`
- `crates/orchestrator-daemon-runtime`
- `crates/orchestrator-providers`
- `crates/orchestrator-git-ops`
- `crates/orchestrator-notifications`
- `crates/orchestrator-session-host`
- `crates/orchestrator-logging`

Plugin host + protocol:

- `crates/orchestrator-plugin-host`
- `crates/animus-plugin-protocol`
- `crates/animus-plugin-runtime`
- `crates/animus-subject-protocol`

Test fixtures (not shipped):

Web surface ships out-of-tree as the `launchapp-dev/animus-web-ui` plugin together
with `animus-transport-http` and `animus-transport-graphql`. Install with
`animus plugin install-defaults --include-transports`.

## Root Resolution And State

Project root resolution is currently:

1. `--project-root`
2. git common root for the current cwd or linked worktree
3. current working directory

Do not document environment-variable fallbacks unless you add them in code.

State layout is split:

- Project-local `.animus/` stores repo config and workflow YAML overlays.
- Scoped runtime state lives in `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/`.
- Global config lives in `protocol::Config::global_config_dir()` and can be overridden with `ANIMUS_CONFIG_DIR`.

Important current paths:

- Project-local config: `.animus/config.json`
- Project-local daemon settings: `.animus/pm-config.json`
- Workflow YAML overlays: `.animus/workflows.yaml`, `.animus/workflows/*.yaml`
- Scoped runtime root: `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/`
- Compiled workflow config: `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/config/workflow-config.v2.json`
- Agent runtime config: `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/config/agent-runtime-config.v2.json`
- State machines: `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/config/state-machines.v1.json`
- Runs: `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/runs/`
- Artifacts: `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/artifacts/`

Legacy readers still probe older repo-local run/artifact paths. Preserve compatibility when needed,
but write new features against the scoped runtime root.

## Working Rules

- Keep the repo Rust-only. Do not add `tauri`, `wry`, `tao`, `gtk`, `webkit*`, `webview*`, or similar desktop-shell dependencies.
- Treat Animus JSON state as tool-managed. Use CLI commands instead of hand-editing `.animus/*.json` or scoped state JSON.
- Supported hand-edit exception: workflow YAML overlays in `.animus/workflows.yaml` and `.animus/workflows/*.yaml`.
- In scripts, CI snippets, and automation, pass `--project-root "$(pwd)"`.
- If you change CLI behavior, update `docs/reference/cli/index.md`.
- If you change MCP tools, update `docs/reference/mcp-tools.md` and `docs/guides/agents.md`.
- Everything is `animus`. New MCP tools are named `animus.<group>.<verb>`, env vars are `ANIMUS_*`, state paths are `.animus/` or `~/.animus/<repo-scope>/`, pack ids are `animus.*`. The CLI is invoked via `animus`. The legacy `ao.*` surfaces were dropped in v0.4.0 (no aliases). See [docs/architecture/naming-contract.md](docs/architecture/naming-contract.md).
- Workflow YAML supports `${VAR}` env-var interpolation for non-secret config (URLs, team IDs, feature flags), with `${VAR:-default}` and `${VAR:?error}` fallback shapes; substitution happens before YAML parsing, and unset required vars fail with file path + line number. API keys and other credentials do NOT belong in workflow YAML — each plugin reads its own secrets from the daemon's process environment (e.g. `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`). See `docs/reference/configuration.md#workflow-yaml-interpolation-non-secret-config`.
- Plugin kill-switches: `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_TRIGGERS=1` skips the trigger plugin supervisor on daemon start (and interrupts in-progress restart backoff); `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_SUBJECT_PLUGINS=1` skips subject plugin discovery entirely. The legacy `ANIMUS_PROVIDER_DISABLE_PLUGIN`, `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_TASK_ADAPTER`, and `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_REQUIREMENTS_ADAPTER` env vars are no-ops as of v0.4.12 — the in-tree adapters were deleted. Both active kill-switches require a daemon restart to take effect. Documented in `docs/reference/configuration.md#plugin-kill-switches`.
- Plugin preflight: as of v0.4.12 the daemon refuses to start when required-role plugins are missing. Use `animus plugin install-defaults` ahead of time or pass `animus daemon start --auto-install` to install recommended defaults on the fly. `--skip-preflight` is the dev escape hatch. Run `animus daemon preflight` for a standalone report.
- Prefer narrow verification over full-workspace rebuilds while iterating.

## Implementation Landmarks

CLI and dispatch:

- `crates/orchestrator-cli/src/main.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-cli/src/cli_types/root_types.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-cli/src/cli_types/`
- `crates/orchestrator-cli/src/shared/output.rs`

Core services and state:

- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/config.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/services.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/services/`
- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/workflow/`

Workflow and runtime config:

- `crates/orchestrator-config/src/workflow_config/`
- `crates/orchestrator-config/src/agent_runtime_config.rs`
- `crates/workflow-runner-v2/src/`

Plugin host + preflight:

- `crates/orchestrator-plugin-host/src/`
- `crates/orchestrator-core/src/services/plugin_preflight.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-cli/src/services/operations/ops_plugin.rs`
- `crates/orchestrator-daemon-runtime/src/control/`

Web UI:

- Out-of-tree at `launchapp-dev/animus-web-ui` (plus `animus-transport-http` / `animus-transport-graphql`). The in-tree `orchestrator-web-server` crate was deleted in v0.4.12.

## CLI Reality Check

Visible top-level command groups currently include:

- `daemon` (with `start`, `run`, `stop`, `status`, `preflight`, ...)
- `agent`, `project`, `queue`, `workflow`, `subject`
- `history`, `git`, `skill`, `model`, `runner`
- `status`, `output`, `mcp`, `web`, `init`, `doctor`
- `pack`, `plugin` (with `install`, `install-defaults`, `list`, `info`, ...), `trigger`, `logs`

Hidden but implemented: none currently.

`animus web serve` does not boot an in-process HTTP server as of v0.4.12.
It discovers installed `transport_backend` + `web_ui` plugins, spawns
them, then opens the browser. Run
`animus plugin install-defaults --include-transports` to install the
standard set (`launchapp-dev/animus-transport-http`,
`animus-transport-graphql`, `animus-web-ui`).

`animus daemon start` and `animus daemon run` perform a plugin preflight
before booting. Default posture is refuse-to-start when any required role
is unsatisfied; the error surfaces the exact `animus plugin install ...`
command to fix it. Flags: `--auto-install` installs recommended defaults
from `launchapp-dev` releases, `--skip-preflight` bypasses the check.
`animus daemon preflight` runs the same check as a standalone report.

Tasks and requirements live exclusively under the unified
`animus subject --kind <kind>` surface as of v0.4.4. The legacy
`animus task` and `animus requirements` command trees were removed.
As of v0.4.12 the in-tree `InTreeTaskSubjectBackend` and
`InTreeRequirementsSubjectBackend` adapters were deleted as well —
all subject ops route through the `SubjectRouter` to installed
`subject_backend` plugins. Install
`launchapp-dev/animus-subject-default` (kind=task) and
`launchapp-dev/animus-subject-requirements` (kind=requirement) via
`animus plugin install-defaults --include-subjects` to keep the
`kind=task` and `kind=requirement` surfaces routable. The
`ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_TASK_ADAPTER` and
`ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_BUILTIN_REQUIREMENTS_ADAPTER` env vars are
deprecated and now no-ops; use
`ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_SUBJECT_PLUGINS=1` to skip subject discovery
entirely.

Also removed in v0.4.4: `animus cloud`, `animus setup`, `animus now`,
and `animus errors`. Use `animus init` (onboarding), `animus status`
(unified inbox + status), and `animus history` (operational error
history) instead. The matching MCP tool families (`ao_task_*`,
`ao_requirements_*`, `ao_cloud_*`, `ao_errors_*`) were dropped at the
same time.

Subject CLI verbs available against any registered backend:

- `animus subject list --kind <kind>`
- `animus subject get --kind <kind> --id <id>`
- `animus subject create --kind <kind> --title <title> [...]`
- `animus subject update --kind <kind> --id <id> [...]`
- `animus subject next --kind <kind>`              (highest-priority Ready)
- `animus subject status --kind <kind> --id <id> --status <s>`

Use `cargo run -p orchestrator-cli -- --help` or `docs/reference/cli/index.md`
when changing or documenting the command tree.

## Service Model

The main production hub is `FileServiceHub`. Tests commonly use `InMemoryServiceHub`.
If you touch orchestration behavior, look for both implementations and update tests accordingly.

Keep these patterns intact:

- CLI output uses the `animus.cli.v1` envelope for `--json`
- state mutations flow through service APIs, not ad hoc file writes
- workflow YAML overlays compile into generated runtime config under scoped state
- git/worktree behavior is repo-scope aware

## Build And Test Commands

Rust:

```bash
cargo animus-fmt
cargo animus-lint
cargo animus-bin-check
cargo test -p orchestrator-cli
cargo test --workspace
```

Prefer targeted crate or package tests while iterating. Use workspace-wide checks when the change
crosses crate boundaries or touches shared contracts.

Web UI sources moved out-of-tree to
`launchapp-dev/animus-web-ui` in v0.4.12 — run the web build commands
in that repo, not here. If GraphQL contracts change, propagate to the
upstream `animus-transport-graphql` plugin repo and bump its pin.

## Animus-Managed Workflow

Animus is meant to self-host its planning and execution state.

Common flow via the unified subject surface (the only surface as of
v0.4.4 — `animus task` and `animus requirements` are gone):

```bash
animus subject next --kind task
animus subject status --kind task --id task:TASK-XXX --status in-progress
animus workflow run --task-id TASK-XXX
animus queue list
animus daemon health
```

If a task is specifically about persistence or migrations, it can justify direct state-file work.
Otherwise, treat Animus state as a command surface, not a manual editing target.
