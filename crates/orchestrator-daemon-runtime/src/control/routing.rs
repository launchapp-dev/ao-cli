//! Routing traits that the daemon's [`super::InProcessSurface`] uses to
//! delegate plugin/* and daemon/* operations back to in-tree CLI logic.
//!
//! Architectural background
//! ------------------------
//!
//! The daemon and the CLI live in the same Rust binary today (`animus`).
//! The CLI's `ops_plugin::run_plugin_*` and `runtime_daemon::*` helpers
//! already implement every operation the control wire needs. C6 wires
//! the daemon's [`super::InProcessSurface`] to *call those same helpers*
//! when a control request arrives over the socket — rather than
//! duplicating the logic.
//!
//! To keep the daemon-runtime crate free of a circular dependency on the
//! orchestrator-cli crate, the wiring goes through these `Arc<dyn Trait>`
//! handles. The CLI binary builds one of each at daemon startup, hands
//! them to the [`super::InProcessSurfaceBuilder`], and the surface
//! delegates blindly. Tests can substitute mock implementations for both
//! routing-via-wire and routing-via-local paths.
//!
//! Anti-deadlock rules
//! -------------------
//!
//! - All methods are `&self` + `Send`. Implementors must not hold a lock
//!   across `.await`; the trait surface awaits each method exactly once.
//! - Handles are `Arc`-cloned at injection, never wrapped in
//!   `tokio::sync::Mutex` by the surface. Implementations are responsible
//!   for any internal synchronization they need.
