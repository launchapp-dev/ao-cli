//! Broadcaster for daemon-side `workflow/events` subscriptions.
//!
//! Subscribers register an optional [`WorkflowEventFilter`] and receive a
//! non-blocking [`mpsc::Receiver`] of [`SubscriberItem`]s — `Event(...)`
//! for normal fan-out, `Closed { reason }` as a terminal frame the
//! connection driver turns into a `subscription/closed` JSON-RPC
//! notification. Slow subscribers do NOT block the emitter — when a
//! subscriber's buffer is full the event is dropped for *that* subscriber
//! only (with a `tracing::warn!`) and the broadcaster continues to fan
//! out to the remaining subscribers.
//!
//! Subscriptions are per-connection: they live only as long as the
//! control-socket connection that opened them. The daemon does not persist
//! subscriptions across restarts. A subscription that pinned its filter to
//! a single `workflow_id` is auto-closed when `workflow_completed` or
//! `workflow_failed` arrives for that workflow.
