//! Per-spawn Unix-domain-socket back-channel for forwarding
//! `workflow_events` from a runner subprocess into the daemon's in-process
//! [`WorkflowEventBroadcaster`].
//!
//! Lifecycle (Unix only — Windows pending):
//!
//! 1. Before [`crate::ProcessManager::spawn_workflow_runner`] forks the
//!    runner, the caller asks for a [`SubprocessEventPipe`] via
//!    [`SubprocessEventPipe::bind`].
//! 2. The pipe binds a freshly-named `UnixListener` under the project's
//!    `~/.animus/<scope>/runs/<workflow-or-subject>/events.pipe` directory
//!    (falls back to `~/.animus/runs/.../events.pipe` when scoped state is
//!    unavailable, e.g. tests with no git context).
//! 3. The path is exposed via the env var
//!    [`workflow_runner_v2::workflow_event_emitter::ANIMUS_WORKFLOW_EVENT_PIPE_ENV`]
//!    on the spawn command; the runner reads it on startup and builds a
//!    [`workflow_runner_v2::SubprocessPipeEmitter`].
//! 4. A reader task per-spawn accepts the (single) inbound connection,
//!    reads newline-delimited JSON frames, deserializes to
//!    [`WireWorkflowEvent`], and forwards each into the broadcaster as a
//!    wire [`animus_control_protocol::types::WorkflowEvent`].
//! 5. On subprocess exit / pipe close the reader task ends and
//!    [`SubprocessEventPipe::cleanup`] removes the socket file.
//!
//! Windows: this module is gated `#[cfg(unix)]`. On Windows the
//! constructor returns `None` and the daemon dispatches without a
//! back-channel — workflow_events from subprocess runs are silently
//! dropped until a Windows transport (named pipes) is wired.
