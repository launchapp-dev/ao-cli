//! Log storage backend integration for the daemon.
//!
//! Mirrors the provider/trigger plugin pattern: at daemon startup we
//! discover every installed plugin and filter for `plugin_kind ==
//! log_storage_backend`. When exactly one is found (and the operator has
//! not set `ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_LOG_STORAGE_PLUGIN`), it becomes the
//! active sink for all daemon-emitted log entries plus `log/entry`
//! notifications forwarded from other supervised plugins. When multiple
//! are found we pick the first by name (deterministic) and emit a
//! warning so operators know fan-out is not yet supported. When none are
//! found, we fall back to the in-tree [`orchestrator_logging::Logger`]
//! which writes structured events to `events.jsonl` — the historical
//! behavior.
//!
//! Anti-deadlock rules (per the v0.4.0 cut design notes):
//!
//! - The dispatch handle is an [`Arc`] over an immutable enum. No
//!   mutexes guard it on the read path because it is set once at daemon
//!   startup and never mutated afterward.
//! - No `Drop` impl on the dispatch touches a lock.
//! - The discovery path uses `std::sync::RwLock` only when caching the
//!   resolved dispatch for the CLI surface; nothing here holds a lock
//!   across `.await`.
