//! Supervises external trigger backend plugins.
//!
//! When the daemon starts it discovers all installed stdio plugins. The
//! [`TriggerSupervisor`] filters that set down to plugins whose manifest
//! declares `plugin_kind = "trigger_backend"`, spawns each as a long-lived
//! subprocess via [`orchestrator_plugin_host::PluginHost`], drives the
//! initialize handshake, sends `trigger/watch`, and forwards `trigger/event`
//! notifications into a router callback that enqueues them against the
//! matching [`WorkflowTrigger`] in `pending_events`.
//!
//! The supervisor owns one Tokio task per plugin. If a plugin's stdio closes
//! cleanly OR the session errors out, the supervisor respawns it inside an
//! outer retry loop with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, capped at
//! 60s). After [`MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS`] consecutive failures it emits a final
//! [`TriggerSupervisorEvent::Crashed`] event and stops trying. Plugins that
//! run cleanly for [`HEALTHY_WINDOW`] reset their attempt counter, so a flaky
//! plugin that crashes every couple minutes doesn't drain its budget.
//!
//! On daemon shutdown the supervisor sends `trigger/ack` for every event id
//! it observed plus a `shutdown` request to each plugin, then waits up to 2
//! seconds for each child to exit.
//!
//! Plugin events are routed to the existing webhook dispatch path by
//! appending to [`orchestrator_core::TriggerRunState::pending_events`]. The
//! tick loop's [`crate::TriggerDispatch::process_due_triggers`] drains those
//! events each tick and spawns the configured workflow.
