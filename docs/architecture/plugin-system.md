# Plugin System

Animus plugins are standalone executables that communicate with the host over
newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout. The host never loads
third-party code into the daemon process as a dynamic library.

## Design Rules

- Compatibility is defined by the wire protocol, not Rust crate linkage.
- Discovery uses `--manifest`; runtime use starts with `initialize`.
- Plugin processes start with `env_clear()`.
- The host forwards only a small base env allowlist, manifest-declared env vars,
  and request-local extras.
- Manifest probe failures become discovery warnings so operators can see why a
  binary was skipped.
- Install state records enough metadata to explain where a plugin came from and
  which binary hash was approved.

## Plugin Kinds

| Kind | Role | Required method family |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | Drives an AI provider or CLI | `agent/run`, `agent/resume`, `agent/cancel`, `health/check` |
| `subject_backend` | Lists, reads, updates, and optionally watches work subjects | Host routes kind-scoped calls such as `<kind>/list`, `<kind>/get`, `<kind>/update`; control surfaces expose `subject/*` |
| `trigger_backend` | Watches external event sources and emits dispatchable trigger events | `trigger/watch`, `trigger/event`, `trigger/ack` |
| `transport_backend` | Hosts an inbound control transport such as HTTP or GraphQL | `transport/start`, `transport/info` or initialize metadata, `transport/shutdown`, `health/check` |
| `web_ui` | Legacy/compat UI wrapper kind | Treated as a browser-facing transport by `animus web` |
| `log_storage_backend` | Receives and serves structured log entries | `log/entry`, `log_storage/tail` |
| `custom` | Plugin-owned behavior, usually bridged to MCP | Any plugin-defined method plus lifecycle methods |
| `task_backend` | Legacy alias | Reserved; new plugins should use `subject_backend` |

`transport_backend` plugins that serve a browser UI advertise the `$ui/web`
capability. `animus web open` uses that marker to prefer a UI URL over a raw API
URL.

## Wire Protocol

Runtime communication is newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0:

1. Host spawns plugin.
2. Host sends `initialize`.
3. Plugin returns `InitializeResult` with protocol version, plugin info, and
   capabilities.
4. Host sends `initialized`.
5. Host sends plugin-specific requests.
6. Plugin sends responses and may emit notifications.

`PluginHost` owns a single reader task for plugin stdout. Responses are matched
to pending JSON-RPC ids and notifications are broadcast to subscribers. This is
documented in [Plugin Host Concurrency](plugin-host-concurrency.md).

## Discovery Order

`discover_plugins(project_root)` uses this order:

1. Registry entries from `~/.animus/plugins.yaml`.
   - Legacy fallback: `~/.config/animus/plugins.yaml` is read only when the new
     registry is absent and `ANIMUS_CONFIG_DIR` is not set.
2. Project-local plugin binaries in `<project>/.animus/plugins/`.
3. The global install dir: `$ANIMUS_PLUGIN_DIR` when explicitly set,
   otherwise `~/.animus/plugins/`.
4. `$ANIMUS_PLUGIN_PATH`.
5. `$PATH`, only when the caller opts into `--include-system-path`.

Directory scans consider executable names beginning with `animus-plugin-` or
`animus-provider-`. Registry entries may point to binaries with any name.
Plugin names are deduplicated by first match in the precedence chain, and a
broken higher-precedence entry still reserves its name so a lower-precedence
copy cannot silently shadow it.

Manifest probes are hardened:

- stdin is closed
- stdout and stderr are capped at 1 MiB
- probe timeout is 5 seconds
- plugin env is scrubbed to the base allowlist
- failures become `DiscoveryWarning` rows

## Installation State

`animus plugin install` writes three forms of state:

| State | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Binary | `~/.animus/plugins/` or `--plugin-dir` | Executable plugin artifact |
| Registry | `~/.animus/plugins.yaml` | Logical name, binary path, install metadata, signature status |
| Lockfile | `<project>/.animus/plugins.lock` or `~/.animus/plugins.lock` | Approved version, artifact sha256, optional signature-bundle sha256 |

The lockfile prevents silent binary replacement during later upgrades.
`animus plugin lock verify` re-hashes installed binaries and reports mismatches.

Supported install sources:

- public GitHub release: `animus plugin install owner/repo[@tag]`
- local binary: `animus plugin install --path ./target/release/my-plugin`
- direct HTTPS URL: `animus plugin install --url <url> --sha256 <hex>`

Direct URL installs require an expected SHA256. Release installs resolve the
platform-specific asset, verify SHA256 and signature policy, probe `--manifest`,
then copy the binary into the install directory.

## Default Plugin Sets

The curated launchapp-dev defaults are defined in
`orchestrator-core::plugin_registry` so daemon preflight and
`animus plugin install-defaults` cannot drift.

| Flag | Installs |
|---|---|
| no extra flag | provider plugins: Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OAI |
| `--include-oai-agent` | optional OAI agent provider |
| `--include-subjects` | default task, requirements, Linear, SQLite, and markdown subject plugins |
| `--include-transports` | HTTP transport, GraphQL transport, and web UI |

Daemon default preflight requires:

- at least one provider plugin
- a subject backend covering `task`
- a subject backend covering `requirement`

`--auto-install` installs the curated defaults for unsatisfied roles.

## Security Boundary

Plugin processes start with `env_clear()`. The host forwards:

- base variables: `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `RUST_LOG`,
  `RUST_BACKTRACE`, `TZ`
- variables declared in `PluginManifest.env_required`
- request-local extras explicitly supplied by the provider session request

If a required declared variable is missing, the host logs a warning but still
spawns the plugin. The plugin decides whether startup should fail.

Release-source installs support cosign keyless verification. Policy modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `strict` | Missing, invalid, or untrusted signatures fail the install |
| `warn` | Verification failures are recorded and warned, but install continues |
| `disabled` | Signature verification is skipped |

Additional install guards:

- manifest name should match the repository basename unless `--force` is used
- unknown GitHub owners trigger trust-on-first-use confirmation
- first-party provider tool names are reserved; installing a plugin that claims
  them requires `--allow-shadow-builtin`

## Runtime Hosting

`PluginHost` owns one live plugin process:

- a single reader task consumes stdout
- requests are written with JSON-RPC ids
- pending responses are resolved by id
- notifications go to a broadcast channel
- shutdown resolves outstanding requests

The broadcast channel capacity defaults to 256 and can be overridden with:

```bash
ANIMUS_PLUGIN_BROADCAST_CAPACITY=512
```

## Provider Path

Provider plugins are driven by `orchestrator-session-host`.

1. Resolve the requested provider tool.
2. Discover `provider` plugins.
3. Spawn and initialize the chosen plugin.
4. Send `agent/run` or `agent/resume`.
5. Forward provider notifications as runner events.
6. Keep the active session host so `agent/cancel` reaches the same process.

There is no in-tree provider fallback. Missing providers return a hard error
with the install command.

The resolver canonicalizes `oai-runner` and `animus-oai-runner` to `oai`.
Reserved provider names are `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `oai`, and
`oai-runner`.

## Subject Path

Subject backends expose normalized work items through the
`animus-subject-protocol` schema. The operator and daemon control surfaces use
generic verbs such as `subject/list` and `subject/get`; the control dispatcher
adapts those calls to the kind-scoped plugin methods used by the router.

The host-side router maps subject kinds to initialized plugin hosts:

- exact kind registrations win over globs
- glob registrations use `kind.*`
- longest glob prefix wins
- duplicate exact kinds and duplicate glob prefixes fail router setup

The current CLI and daemon path relies on these kind-scoped plugin calls:

| Plugin method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<kind>/list` | Return filtered subjects for dispatch or CLI listing |
| `<kind>/get` | Fetch one subject |
| `<kind>/create` | Create one subject when the backend supports mutation |
| `<kind>/update` | Apply a merge-style patch |
| `<kind>/next` | Return the next runnable subject for a kind |
| `<kind>/status` | Change a subject's status |

Protocol-level subject backends may also expose schema and watch capabilities,
but current routing decisions are made from the initialized plugin manifest and
`capabilities.subject_kinds`.

## Trigger Path

Trigger plugins are long-lived watchers. The daemon sends `trigger/watch` with
optional cursor and config, then receives `trigger/event` notifications. Each
event carries an event id, optional trigger id, optional subject id/kind,
optional action hint, and plugin-owned payload. The host sends `trigger/ack`
after accepting an event.

Trigger supervision has a daemon kill switch:

```bash
ANIMUS_DAEMON_DISABLE_TRIGGERS=1 animus daemon start
```

## Transport and Web Path

`animus web serve` and `animus web open` use normal plugin discovery, then
partition discovered plugins into:

- `transport_backend`
- `web_ui`

The web command starts transport plugins and opens the UI URL advertised by a
plugin with `$ui/web` capability. There is no in-tree web server. Spawn uses
the plugin manifest's `env_required` contract, so missing required vars fail
fast before handshake the same way `animus plugin info`, `ping`, and `call` do.

## Operations

Useful operator commands:

```bash
animus plugin list
animus plugin install-defaults --include-subjects --include-transports
animus plugin info --name <name>
animus plugin call <name> health/check --json '{}'
animus plugin lock verify
animus daemon preflight
```

## Tests

Use these focused checks when changing plugin behavior:

```bash
cargo test -p orchestrator-plugin-host
cargo test -p orchestrator-session-host
cargo test -p orchestrator-cli plugin
cargo animus-bin-check
```
